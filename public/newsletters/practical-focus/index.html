        <div id="article-body" class="article-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>We talked <a href="/newsletters/focus-in-a-noisy-world/">last week</a> about some theory and strategy behind achieving focus in a noisy world. </p>
<p>Our principal strategy is still about cutting out options, distractions, decisions. The less we have to choose from, the easier it is to act.</p>
<p>Now it's time to get practical. Here are three ways I've found to be very effective in helping me focus.</p>
<h2>1. The Tomato Technique</h2>
<p>Taking rests is crucial to maintaining our focus and energy—our overall well-being, really. The hard part is getting back into the groove after a break. The pomodoro method is one way to help with this. </p>
<p>(FYI, <em>pomodoro</em> means <em>tomato</em> in Italian. Francesco Cirillo, the inventor of this method, named it after a tomato-shaped kitchen timer that he used.)</p>
<h3>How To</h3>
<p>It goes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a specific task—what you want to accomplish or at least work on during this time.</li>
<li>Set a timer for 25 minutes—this is your all-in work time. Only work on that task you chose.</li>
<li>Once the timer runs out, take a 5-minute break.</li>
</ol>
<p>Repeat this cycle for 4 sessions, then take a longer break.</p>
<p>You can find more information on the official <a href="https://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro Technique website</a>.</p>
<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>
<p>This has been a great technique for me to add in some structure to complicated tasks. With coding, sometimes a problem feels so confusing or even feels so huge that it keeps me from starting.</p>
<p>Setting the timer helps my brain focus on one task and since it's finite, I can more easily dive in because I know that the &quot;pain&quot; will end. </p>
<p>My main critique of this method is that it does not reduce my stress as much as the method claims. Part of that is my personality. Part of that is feeling like I'm back in school, taking a test and the ever-present consciousness of time creates its own distraction from my task.</p>
<p>So I found a modification to this...</p>
<h2>2. Hourglass</h2>
<p>Combine an ancient technology with modern technology and you've got a sweet spot.</p>

    <figcaption>Hourglass next to my keyboard and mouse.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I was extremely stressed at work two years ago. I had a tyrant manager that weighed on my days and nights. I wasn't sleeping well, I wasn't working well, I wasn't feeling well.</p>
<p>In my desperation to find ways to calm my anxiety and reconnect with my focus and productivity, I received a beautiful hourglass filled with black sand for my birthday.</p>
<p>The soothing, subtle sounds of tiny grains of sand running through the narrow funnel and piling at the bottom made this hourglass mesmerizing. It acted as both a meditation device and eventually a productivity enhancement.</p>
<p>I started the hourglass with the same intent as the pomodoro technique: to work for the whole time the sand was running, which was about 20 minutes.</p>
<p>It had the same effect, but something about the subtle end of the hourglass made the process so much less stressful. There's no jarring beeps or dings or alarm-music when an hourglass timer runs out.</p>
<p>It simply stops in the background and allows you to either notice and stop, or slowly wind down your task.</p>
<p>For my highly anxious mind at the time, this was the perfect modification to help me initiate my focus without over-burdening my mental space.</p>
<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>
<p>If you have a task where you absolutely need to know how much time you have left, the classic pomodoro technique will work better. It's tough to tell what time is remaining with an hourglass, since all you can do is compare how much sand is at the top and bottom.</p>
<p>You also have to have an hourglass for this to work...but there are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wGWT2Om8ls">ways around this</a>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I believe this method is superior if you're struggling with anxiety or if you're already in a stressed state.</p>
<h2>3. Desktop Meditation</h2>
<p>As noted earlier, part of focus is having good rest. Jumping on Facebook or whatever social media app on your phone between tasks is an awful way to rest. It feels good, but it takes a toll since your mind isn't really resting.</p>
<p>There a several great ways to facilitate a good break: <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/reports-and-publications/physical-activity-nutrition/walking-executive-summary/index.html">taking a walk</a> or doing some other movements and physical activity are the best. </p>
<p>The point is doing something distinct and also something where you really aren't using your brain the way you do for your tasks at work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ch. 11 Dao De Jing - Translated by Roger Ames &amp; David L. Hall
&quot;Thus, it might be something that provides the value, but it is nothing that provides the utility.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nothingness provides utility. Dao De Jing is referring to containers or pots in that passage, but it also applies to our minds. The product of our thinking is valuable, but it is the breaks and rest that provides the utility of (or the access to) our productive thinking.</p>
<p>Here are a two more ways I've found helpful in creating restful space—especially on a time crunch, in limited space, and/or in a stressed state.</p>
<h3>Zen Garden</h3>
<p>I grabbed a small wooden box, lined it with plastic wrap, and dumped in some crafting sand I had laying around. I cleared off space on my computer desk for my mini sandbox. Using a small stone, I began to draw patterns in the sand.</p>
<p>Something about watching the sand move and tumble is relaxing, just like it was with the hourglass.</p>
<p>I spent only a few minutes tracing temporary lines and I was already in love with this technique.</p>

</figure>
<p>Meditation is a hard practice. We know it has benefits, but setting aside the time to just sit and breathe is tough. This form of kinetic meditation, though, is a lot easier to access in my experience.</p>
<p>When I could feel my emotions starting drive my actions at work, I would stop and pick up my stone and doodle some lines in my zen garden.</p>
<p>It's a powerful way to reset focus, to calm anxiety, and facilitate real rest.</p>
<h3>Drawing</h3>
<p>If you don't have the space or the sand for a zen garden, a simple pad of paper and a pen can take its place.</p>
<p>Doodling is essentially what I was doing in the sand, so doing the same thing on paper should work in a similar manner.</p>
<p>Drawing like this isn't about artistic expression or &quot;being good.&quot; It's just a way to let go, occupy your hands, and let your mind rest by changing up the scene. </p>
<p>Ironically, as an artist, I've found doodling to be a difficult thing to do, which is why I appreciated this video where Jazza, a YouTube artist, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd8w6G3_nP4">explores different doodling techniques</a>. Maybe one of them can help you out if you want to try doodling but don't know how to start.</p>
<h2>Cyborg</h2>
<p>Initiating focus, retaining focus, and resting to replenish focus is tough in a noisy world. </p>
<p>Sometimes we even sabotage our own attempts at staying focused by being too worried about our focus—kinda like when you're laying in bed telling yourself, &quot;Come on, go to sleep, I need to sleep.&quot;</p>
<p>There are many more tips and tricks out there, but remember that more options harms our ability to act. So, consider the things you've already done that help you focus and stick to those.</p>
<p>Or, give a shot to one of the methods we discussed here. Just make sure you only try one thing. </p>
<p>Focus and decision-making are similar skills. Let's do this.</p>
