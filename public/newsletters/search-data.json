He had just listed 10 rules, tips, and recommendations for how to get the wheel going, aim, slam the ball of clay down, and start working with the clay to make sure it was centered.\nThat's all step one?!\nThus started my struggle with the rest of the class. \nThere were actually two points of pressure and struggle, which I have found come by default when doing any kind of art.\n\nPerformance: what you expect to create vs. what is actually created. The larger that difference, the more disappointing it can be.\nComparison: it's next to impossible to not compare what I'm doing with everyone else around me\u2014or with work I've seen before.\n\nOne of the other classmates in this 2-hour workshop with the wheel had recently been in college and had taken a pottery class. This meant she was already familiar with everything that was involved and could create more interesting pieces during the class than the rest of us.\nI had taken my mom to this class as well, so I started feeling a lot of pressure to perform. I have a BFA in Graphic Design, art is an integral part of my life, I should be able to plug into this new medium just fine.\nBut I didn't do well. My mom did amazing. The recent college grad did amazing.\nThe only thing that saved this for me was the experience I've gained in practicing art. I am very aware of how much pressure I put on myself to perform. How tempting it is to compare. Knowing this, I made a very concentrated effort to do the opposite. \nI am here to learn something totally new. That means it'll be bad and messy and I'll fail a lot.\nI am here to be an artist for me. This college grad doesn't need to know that I didn't just take one art class, my main college experience was art classes. I don't need to talk about how much I know. I don't need to worry about how my first three pots I've ever made in my whole life don't look nearly as good as hers.\nFor a competitive person, this is agony, but I finally am wrapping my head around the fact that it is greater agony to play the comparison and disappointment game.\nArt taught me that. I had to do it publicly for years to learn all of this. I had to be embarrassed and scared. I had to keep showing up.\nEventually I was able to make one final, decent bowl, thanks to the teacher helping me start well-centered. \nSubtly showing you my best piece and somehow omitting the other two... ;) \n\n\nClay bowl on the potter's wheel\n\nCentering the clay is the most important part of the whole process. Everything after that is easier and sometimes self-working. \nCentering ourselves is one of our most important practices in life. I guess that means everything after that is easier (maybe?) and sometimes self-working.\nCyborg\nArt is the combination of technology and creativity. We use technology to create all forms of art\u2014visual, audio, etc.\nI think that's why art is such a great teacher. It takes our use of available tech and shows us how to apply it in ways that are productive, beautiful, satisfying, or useful.\nThe hard part is choosing to do art. It's hard to perform and it's hard to let go of the judgment.\nHowever, I'm pretty convinced that art will be even more important for humans to get first-hand experience with the more that AI develops, the more digital our lives become, the more technology dominates our attention.\nGo try something new as soon as you can. \nHere are some places to look:\n\nPottery Classes Near You\nNo judgment art exercise: Blind Contour Drawing (it's gonna look bad on purpose!)\nLearn 3 EASY Rubber Band Magic Tricks (Art = Magic = Art)\nDraw today's pose on Posemaniacs (Human anatomy models, shows computer generated, human models with musculature, no skin)\n Tags: Creativity"}, {"title": "Health Vs.

Where once my thoughts were preoccupied with work, automation, and productivity, I needed to explore different skills. \u00b6 What does a perfectionist, workaholic, achievement-motivated, competitive person do when health problems disrupt their abilities and their control?\nIt's the question I've struggled with for the last 6 years after being diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS).\nIt's the reason I've looked to technology so much for the answers\u2014for leverage and power. I need technology to supplement where my humanness falls short.\n\nSo, it's a different style of CYBORG_ this week, and I hope you find it helpful! However, quick disclaimer: I'm not a therapist nor a doctor. None of this is medical advice. Consult appropriate physicians for your situation.\n\nThis is all so raw for me this week because of a debilitating injury with my nerves on my shoulder and neck. I was terrified of triggering another MS attack with the injury and added stress. \nSo, again, I ask, what do you do? What do you do when you can't do anything?\nGetting Good at Rest\nHa! I laugh at my own heading. This is a target, not something I currently know how to do, but something I know I must learn.\nHere's what MS has taught me so far:\n\nChoose to rest or the choice will be taken from you.\nIf you can go today, then go. If you can't, don't.\nBelieve people when they say they can't. They know their limits. Extend that same belief to your own body's limits.\n\nEven these rules must be taken in balance. I noticed that in the years immediately following my MS attack and diagnosis, these rules were very valuable to me in cultivating some compassion, plus the reality check that I needed.\nNow that we're closer to my 6-year anniversary of the diagnosis and I have made considerable progress in my health and wellness, some of these rules have been abused.\nEspecially #2: if I can go, then I really go. This past week was a warning sign that feeling good is temporary. Rest is not something I can diminish. I still need to bring mindfulness to my drive for achievement.\nTo support my need for rest (and hopefully yours, too), I've been considering the nature of rest.\nTypes of Rest\nThis Psychology Today article suggests that there are 7 different kinds of rest. Sleep is not the only kind of rest that there is\u2014and that's encouraging. They identify:\n\nphysical\nmental\nsensory\nemotional\nsocial\ncreative\nspiritual\nand (bonus) systemic rest\n\nOne of the things I've been working on with my therapist is discovering and documenting the activities that help me rest, recharge, or reset in order to help balance my over-productive tendencies.\nI'd encourage you to find activities that create rest for each of the types above. I'll be doing the same.\nIt might help to consider this spin on &quot;types of rest&quot;\u2014while I'm not familiar with this creator, the list she provides is a little less vague, so it might spark some ideas. These are her types:\n\ntime away\npermission to not be helpful\nsomething \u201cunproductive\u201d\nappreciating art and nature \nsolitude to recharge\na break from responsibility\nstillness to decompress\nsafe space\nalone time at home\n\nIntentional Mindlessness\nWhile it is obvious that an excess of mindless activities is counter-productive and sometimes damaging, there surely is a necessary balance where mindlessness is healthy.\nVideo games were my saving grace this weekend. I still feel guilty about playing so much, but it did help take my mind off of the pain, pass the time, and allowed me an easy way to get lots of rounds of icing / heating my injury.\nTo my surprise, my therapist told me that the guilt for choosing video games was unnecessary. She wants me to find more of these &quot;mindless&quot; activities so that I can have a list at the ready in cases of emergency or need.\nSo...help me out\u2014hit reply on this email if you have any ideas of mindless activities that can facilitate rest and recovery.\nBalance is Everything\nHave you seen a gyroscope? I think they're a great metaphor for the balance we need in our modern world. It's not just balancing a single plane, like scales or even someone on a tightrope.\nIt has a spinning wheel at the center, and as long as it keeps spinning, it provides incredible balance, because it resists forces to change its orientation.\nNot a physicist here, but it seems like this is key to achieving balance: combining the movement with the stillness. Neither the parts at rest nor the parts in motion will be effective on their own. Once the right balance of the two is struck, it's so much harder to knock down the whole system.\nWe all have limits. We all have potential. We all have control over our own system. \nBalance is achieved when both stillness and motion are at play. So in a world of &quot;hustle and grind,&quot; let's remember to &quot;rest easy,&quot; too.

Some of it is hair-on-fire urgent and some of it are those nice-to-have fantasies from an unnecessarily long meeting.\n-OR-\nYou're starting a business. Gotta get the license, oh and the website domain, oh and the bank account so I can charge my first customer, oh and I need a logo, and...\n-OR-\nYou get home. The sprinkler is broken and the light bulb in the basement is out. There's dirty dishes in the sink and the garbage is full.\nWe've all been here.\nThere's too much to do and not enough time or energy to do it all.\nLife is a never ending to-do list.\nIt is completely overwhelming and paralyzing when you take a step back to observe everything that is required of you. The more people in your life, the more things are asked of you. The more places you go, groups you join, interests you have, it all expands.\nWhat to do?!\nOnce we have a better understanding of the problem\u2014the real problem\u2014we'll be in the right frame to dig into the solutions. Here's what we might have missed at first glance:\n\nIt's not necessarily a bad thing that these activities, responsibilities, etc. expand to fill our lives.\nIt's not enough to simply remove activities\u2014the day will be filled regardless of how much or how little we shove into it.\n\nWoah, wait, #2 sounds like a paradox\u2014what's going on?\nTake a look at what's called Parkinson's Law:\n\n&quot;It is a commonplace observation that work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.&quot;\n\u2014Cyril Northcote Parkinson\n\nThis is very easy to visualize as a student or an employee. You get an assignment and a due date. How long does it take to get that assignment done? Usually however long you have until the due date.\nObviously, this isn't a real law, like in physics, but it's a pretty common framework for looking at how work gets done. With few exceptions, we take all the time that was given to us to complete our assignments.\nKnowing this has been extremely powerful for me, especially in getting my projects done on time consistently at work and in drawing healthy boundaries.\nDue dates\nHumans are really bad at estimating how long something takes. How long does it take to make a logo? A website? A song?\nWell, those are creative things, of course it's hard to put a time on those.\nHow long does it take to finish a math assignment? What about a bank reconciliation? How about chopping onions?\nA lot of these activities have the same formula to calculate completion time: \nremainder(\u201cyour skills\u201d / \u201cit depends\u201d ) - \u201cdue date\u201d\nThe level of expertise you have in a specific area gives you a more refined sense of how long something will take, but you also have to take into consideration the variables. \nIt depends       ...on how much content.\n...on how much I'm getting paid for this.\n...on how long I have to get it done.\nAll due dates are imaginary but the pressure we feel as they approach is very real.\nThey're a tool we can use to our advantage. That's how we say &quot;enough is enough&quot; and complete our projects. \nWithout them, the to-dos continue to bubble up. This is the same for procrastinators and over-achievers. Work expands to fill the time available.\nExtreme Prioritization\nRemembering the point of a project is crucial. There's usually some kind of goal for a project (even if it's misguided). Keeping that ultimate goal or desired outcome in mind will help weed out what is critical to keep or finish as part of your project. Everything else is a nice-to-have.\nDevelopers tend to be pretty good at this. We have 6 weeks to build some feature into the program. After exploration and experimentation, that due date looms ever closer, so we start looking at the mess we've got in front of us.\n&quot;Well, this part hasn't been working this whole time, and it doesn't really do what Feature X ultimately needs to do, so let's scrap it.&quot;\n&quot;I was going to add some extra functionality here, but that can wait until after the launch date.&quot;\n&quot;There's actually an easier way to solve this if we change direction just a little bit. With sign-off from Design, this even takes care of two other old problems we've been trying to solve.&quot;\nWatching the project evolve over the course of time is very instructive. Almost nothing is fixed, almost nothing is impossible. It's healthy to take parts of the project that aren't aligned and put them in the backlog\u2014using good communication to others about that re-prioritization.\nIt\u2019s all about prioritizing for the goal.\nObviously, there are unreasonable goals and impossible solutions\u2014but I'm not so sure there are impossible problems (foreshadowing for an upcoming CYBORG_).\nMy question for you is: Do you see this pattern of minor pivots in your work? In the most recent project that you worked on, did you ever change your approach in order to meet the deadline?\nPrioritization is fairly intuitive, but it's subconscious. Extreme prioritization is when we are aware and deliberate in that process. Tags: "}, {"title": "Do it custom once", "category": "Newsletters", "href": "/newsletters/do-it-custom-once/", "body": "Turning one-off creative efforts into repeatable systems can reduce mental load and keep your projects moving forward. \u00b6 \u2026after that, it\u2019s time to templatize or automate.\nThere are lots of reasons to do things in a new way, as a custom \u201cone-off.\u201d\nYour website home page probably should be your most unique page. Your first attempt to learn something. Your answer to a coworker\u2019s question. Your prototype.\nAs soon as it\u2019s time to do it again, it\u2019s also time to offload that cognitive load or the extra code into a system that starts to take care of the thing for you.\nLet\u2019s get practical\nI ask people to do a \u201chard refresh\u201d ALL THE TIME at work. When you visit a website, your browser stores a little cache so that it doesn\u2019t have to work as hard the next time you go to the same page (woah, that\u2019s a little meta).\nThe problem is that when I\u2019ve updated the styles\u2014the visual code\u2014the browser may still show the old visuals thanks to that cache.\nI tell people to go check the site for the new update and they come back in a panic, because they are seeing their old cached page.\nThen I tell them, \u201cthere may be some caching\u2014try a hard refresh (CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + R) on that page to clear your browser cache.\u201d\nSince no one knows what a hard refresh is, I made a text shortcut to insert the keyboard combo for me. Now I can type hr and the computer swaps it out with: hard refresh (CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + R)\nText expanders are a great micro-automation for anyone using a computer.\n\u200bWatch how I set that up on a Mac\u200b\nSystems\nWe may be tempted to dismiss this idea, because what we do is so much more complex. How can I just automate something that is by definition custom every time? Working with people, creating designs or art, writing articles.\nFirst, there are always processes around your custom thing that could (and probably should) be automated. It will serve you well to become aware of all of the repetitive things that you do, so that you can see how much extra work you're doing.\nThe systems we engage with to produce our custom thing are either unwittingly ruling you right now or they are waiting to be optimized.\nWork Backwards\nIt may be helpful to look at the outcome of your custom thing and then retrace your steps.\nFor example, I have a finished artwork uploaded to my custom t-shirt store. Just before that, I had to enter in a bunch of tags describing my artwork\u2014most are the same, since this is part of a series.\nThat\u2019s our first tiny optimization opportunity. I could store all of the tags that are consistent across my series in one place and copy them over. (Or even just use the text expansion we talked about earlier.)\nKeep rewinding:\n\nI cropped my image in Photoshop to be close to the boundaries of the artwork.\nI turned off the background color.\nI QA\u2019d the image looking for any spots I missed while coloring or lines that aren\u2019t right.\nI finished each layer.\nI opened a new canvas.\nI chose a sketch to redraw digitally.\nI sketched the initial version.\n\nPhew, that\u2019s a lot of custom work. Some of it can still be automated and save me some time (especially through templates).\nMaybe even more important, writing out this process has saved some cognitive load.\nMental Drain\nWe looked at a pretty custom process. The biggest problem with this is actually that custom projects drain us. Sometimes\u2014and especially with side-projects or hobbies\u2014the fact that the thing we want to do is so custom, it feels harder to do. That feeling increases the chance we\u2019ll give up on it before we finish.\nA good way to help reduce this drain is by creating systems around it.\nIf I had to look up the dimensions every time I started a new t-shirt, I\u2019m already delaying my creative engagement and stacking up mental load.\nIt sounds silly, but think back to the project or two you\u2019ve got in the garage. You were so excited about it, but abandoned it because you hit a snag or you somehow lost steam. Don\u2019t worry, I have plenty of those, too.\nEven if you just documented the steps you take in this custom production process like we did with the t-shirts, that\u2019s a whole lotta mental load you\u2019ve now alleviated.\nIt\u2019s way easier to follow a guide than to try and bushwhack your way through a new path every time.\nStill better that you, yourself, made that guide. You don\u2019t have to feel guilty for creating processes around your creative or custom endeavor. You just created something that will serve that custom thing in orders of magnitude over time.\nCyborg\nThere are systems everywhere, for everything. The worst system is the one you\u2019re not aware of.\nIt may be as innocent as the habits you\u2019ve formed as you do or create your custom thing. It may be as sinister as social systems that oppress people who aren\u2019t like you.\nWhile we\u2019re not solving for the social systems in this article, it feels irresponsible not to mention it\u2014maybe we\u2019ll talk about that in a later email. If you have thoughts, feel free to reply and let me know!\nThe best thing you can do is start to look for the systems at play. Identify as many as possible. They may be disguised as routines, habits, or preparation work.\nIntentionally creating or optimizing systems helps you take control of your work. I believe it fosters creativity, despite an intuition that it would do the opposite.\nI think our humanity is best served when we discover systems, update them, and only do a truly custom thing once. After that, we integrate it so we have capacity for the next big thing to solve.

The goal of this newsletter is to find ways to allow technology to extend our capabilities and our humanity, help us with our personal goals, and maybe even compensate where we lack.\nLet's first explore what the spider does with its web, and then see how that has everything to do with our own &quot;webs.&quot;\nThe (Organic) Web\nThe world-wide web is not just about the physical connections between computers, mimicking a spider web, it's all about information transfer.\nThe original, organic web that a spider weaves with its silk is a mechanism for information transfer as well.\nI'll be using quotes from, &quot;An Immense World,&quot; by Ed Yong in this section (highly recommended reading!) to help us understand the relationship of a spider and its web.\n&quot;...[the web is] a surveillance system which extends the range of the spider's senses well beyond the reach of its body.&quot;\n&quot;...it is built by the spider and it is part of the spider.&quot;\nThat sounds a lot like our goals of becoming cyborgs: using technology built by humans that can be integrated into our lives, extending the range of our senses. (I would add that at least for this cyborg, I want it to be a safe, healthy integration.)\nFor the spider, vibrations are the information that gets sent up and down the web. It helps alert our predatory friend of a meal or the benign brush of a leaf. \nInterestingly, a web-weaving spider is not typically going to be able to distinguish certain things that are physically around it until it interacts with the web. As described in the book, the arachnid might well wave off a fly buzzing around, only to recognize it as dinner when the fly hits the web.\nIts web not only communicates to the spider, it can also extend the spider's mind.\n&quot;[Zoologist Takeshi] Watanabe found that a well-fed [Japanese Orb Weaver] will also go after small flies if it is placed onto a tense web built by a hungry spider. The spider has effectively outsourced the decision of which prey to attack to its web.&quot;\n\n    \n    Spider \"plugging into\" another web\n\nEven more amazing is the spider species that are, in all senses of the word, hackers. For example, the Dewdrop Spider can steal stored prey from larger spiders by hacking their webs.\n&quot;From a nearby hiding place, it runs several lines of silk over to the [spokes of a] web, effectively plugging its sensory system into that of the larger spider. It can tell when [the larger spider] has caught something and is wrapping it in silk for storage. It then runs over and eats the insect itself, often cutting it free from the main web so that the host spider can no longer detect it.&quot;\nSpider Thinking\nAll of these little snippets of the spider, its web, and its world have direct parallels to ours that I think we need to explore, even at the risk of anthropomorphizing too much ;)\nBuild your web\nLet's revisit this quote first, &quot;...[the web] is built by the spider and it is part of the spider.&quot;\nMy personal take on this is that for technology to be effectively and healthily integrated into our lives, we ought to participate in its creation.\nThat does not mean we all have to become programmers\u2014I don't even think coding is necessary at all. \nTechnology at its loosest definition is about applying knowledge, not about bits and bytes. If you are taking your knowledge, applying it, contributing to it, connecting it to other knowledge, that is building your web.\nThis is already a natural behavior of ours, so why bother pointing this out?\nIntention is the other half of building. We all have powerful systems, technology, and knowledge in front of us. What will we do with it? What do we prioritize? What do we choose most often?\nI think we need to be exceptionally conscious of our decisions, our actions, our tools. Tech companies have given us incredible power\u2014but they are not without bias or motives as much as we are not without such things.\nBuild your web, and do so carefully. The technology you build will become a part of you, so choose well\u2014and don't be afraid to let go of parts that are no longer serving you.\nDecision Making\nJust like the spider can outsource decisions to its web, we do the same to our digital and technological landscape.\nCalendar items, reminders, notes, photo albums, and so much more information is ported from our heads or our experiences and onto tools or the Internet.\nThis is, overall, a great thing\u2014that is not to be understated. Cognitive offloading has been a hugely beneficial practice for me as I tackle complex problems at work that I just can't hold all at once in my working memory.\nIt also helps me with my mental health to be able to process things as I write them down. \nThe notes I take have a direct impact on the quality of my outputs\u2014like this newsletter, hopefully. \nWith MS as a massive barrier to my energy, I simply could not do what I'm doing now without the help of the web of technology that I have built. \nThese tools help me automate decisions I have already made, but that are recurring. They help me detect errors, solve problems, and think more deeply.\nAs with everything, there is still a cost, which we see in the Japanese Orb Weaver experiment.\nIf a well-fed spider is still taking cues from the web it is on to stuff itself even when unnecessary, we too can be trapped in a cycle of constant stimulation or content overload.\nIt's so important that we interact with our tech on our terms. Apps with &quot;feeds&quot; are already giving us a hint at what they're doing\u2014placing us on their pre-built web, making us feel &quot;hungry&quot; for more and more even when we're not.\nI'm not against social media\u2014I use it frequently\u2014but I am against attention-hacking and sly tactics that grab onto our precious mental and emotional resources and can hardly let go. \nIntention and agency are critical to guard.\nHackers\nWe now need to address the spider in the room: hackers.\nIt's fascinating to see that nature has exploiters, tricksters, and thieves to examine. \nAside from the &quot;technical&quot; approach that the Dewdrop Spider showed us by physically hacking into another spider's web, there are other forms of exploitation.\nFirst, do ensure that you take precautions online. Hacking is a legitimate concern and we can all do better to make sure our passwords are strong, our personal information is rarely given out and only to must-have parties.\nIf you want to learn more about cyber-security, there are a few creators you can check out:\n\nShannon Morse (I actually discovered her on this collab video focused on YouTuber safety, but she was pretty good at explaining things in a more accessible way)\nNetwork Chuck (More technical)\nKnowBe4 (This is a business, so ignore their testimonials / marketing videos, but still has a lot of great videos for general audiences)\n\n\n    \n    Spider using a computer\n\nSecond, we also need to be aware of the ways that we can be tricked or manipulated by the other &quot;dewdrop spiders&quot; we may encounter.\nFor example, a thief-spider doesn't have to just tap into the web, it also uses tactics like mimicking the vibrations of a non-insect\u2014making the orb weaver think that a twig or a leaf has landed on its web instead of another spider deceiving it.\n(Apparently some &quot;assassin bugs&quot; will use this technique to fool the spider and charge up to it for the kill.)\nPretending to be something it's not is probably the most common form of &quot;hacking&quot; we face, whether it be through overt scams or even companies making promises about their technologies that just aren't true, even if believed by the company (Theranos, anyone?).\nHere are some other resources about scams, specifically:\n\nUS FTC's article, &quot;How to Avoid a Scam&quot;\nMark Rober's scam caller takedown video (Really important to see how scammers work to deceive people, and this one is entertaining.)\n\nAI is another deceptive one. While masquerading as a trustworthy being, it just isn't. Yes, I use generative AI like ChatGPT, but it's always with scrutiny and suspicion.\nWe humans have explored the idea of AI and human interaction for more than a century\u2014potentially for thousands of years, depending on how you define, &quot;artificial intelligence.&quot; These stories inform our thinking as well as the thinking and designs of the people creating AI tools.\nIt is wise to be aware of the myths we have surrounding AI, and to remember that our brains have biological biases (see a previous CYBORG_ issue) that help to further deceive us into thinking these chatbots are safe, trustworthy, and relatable.\nCyborg\nThere was a lot here, and the last section got a little heavy, so let's recap.\nThe technology with which we surround ourselves is powerful and important. Make no mistake, I default to advocating for technology\u2014more tech, better tech. \nA healthy cyborg remembers that all things must be balanced. There are costs and risks on the same scale as the benefits and rewards.\nAwareness is so important for our safety, but it also can't be our obsession to the point of overwhelm or non-action. So be safe, trust your instincts, learn about cyber-security, but don't over-invest in fear.\nOur webs have brought us unprecedented freedom, knowledge, power, and potential. Take an active role in creating and building the web of technology that will best suit your needs and keep you in the driver seat.\nIn my experience, technology has helped me work through the most difficult problems of my life, from salvaging a career despite my diagnosis of MS to connecting to people and community that have saved me in other ways.\nPerhaps the most important thing I've learned from our spider friends is that it is ok to use the technology we have available. Use it to extend ourselves, our abilities. A spider is a great model of an organic cyborg. Tags: "}, {"title": "A Death in the Family", "category": "Newsletters", "href": "/newsletters/a-death-in-the-family/", "body": " \u00b6 There have always been difficult events that offer us chances to reflect on our humanity and the other existential questions that swirl around us. The death of a loved one is obviously a potent example.\nI didn't intend to write this article today, but with the passing of my grandpa\u2014the first death in my family that I've ever experienced\u2014it seemed important for me to share two snippets of wisdom regarding death.\nThe first comes from elephants.\nNational Geographic's series, Queens, Episode 4, showed a beautiful, surprising scene of what happened when a traveling herd of elephants find the skeleton of another elephant along the way.\nThey circle the bones and allow each one in the herd to touch the bones. It's a ritual. It was stunning to see these massive mammals mourning and honoring their dead. \nSometimes the word &quot;ritual&quot; has a weird connotation to it\u2014like it's not part of our modern lives or perhaps it's tied to some cult-like performance. However, rituals can help us connect with others or ourselves, recharge our energy and motivation for work, or process difficult emotions.\nFunerals and graveside services are some rituals we've retained, though lately I have wondered if there are better ways to mourn the dead that we have lost over time. Particularly in my religious culture, I'm not sure my faith group has a healthy way of dealing with death\u2014my therapist, who is also in this group put it this way: &quot;We're not very good at being sad. There's always a silver lining.&quot;\nThis leads to the last bit of wisdom I've recently found, encouraging us not to avoid death, diminish its importance, or hide it under platitudes. \nFrom the commentary on Chapter 58 of Dao De Jing (translated by Roger Ames and David L. Hall):\n\n&quot;How do we respond to this never-ending spiral of reversion? If we have an understanding of the process as a whole, we can, while staying balanced at the center, anticipate the movement between opposites. While we can certainly live a robust and healthy life, we can also, in the fulness of time, enjoy a consummatory and healthy death. \nDeath is real and wherever there is life, it is not far away. However, to separate death out from the life experience and inveigh against it as something to be avoided at all costs prevents us from appreciating the fragility and preciousness of life that is made possible by the same delicious temporality. \nLife is made meaningful by death. Death as natural closure, punctuates a most particular event in the on-going transformation of things. Properly understood, a healthy death can be lived well and can enhance the lives of all involved. Misunderstood, a resentful death can sour life and become a focus of dread and loathing that robs everyone, especially those left to carry on, of their life energy.&quot;\n\nAcknowledging death is a way to &quot;plug&quot; back into reality, outside of our technology-driven thoughts, experiences, and work. It's a reminder for me that I am human, I am fragile, and that's ok.

How unseen decisions can impact trust and empowerment. \u00b6 There's a delicate balance of ease and control.\nThe concepts behind the iPhone and other tech products for the mass market led to more simplified experiences. You have to make things really easy and simple if you want to target &quot;unskilled&quot; populations.\nI'm not trying to insult anyone, but I have noticed that these last few years of everything getting &quot;easier&quot; has also led some knowledge workers to be less skilled than before.\nI think it's due to the blackbox issue.\nPeople are used to systems removing decisions from them\u2014usually decisions they don't even know are available. This makes complicated processes super easy. And yet, that terrifies me more often than not.\nAs a developer, I have seen into the complexity of &quot;simple&quot; things, like sending an email newsletter, building a website, creating scripts and automations. \nThis perspective makes me suspicious of processes that are &quot;too easy,&quot; because I don't know how to verify that the process/system is making the right decisions or that they're making all of the decisions that I want it to make.\nSystems ARE Decisions\nIf you've never programmed anything, a system can sound like a blackbox in itself. Something you can't touch, interact with, or understand.\nBut systems come naturally to the vast majority of us. If you've ever brushed your teeth more than once, you've developed a system for it.\nGet brush. Wet brush. Squeeze toothpaste onto brush. Swirl brush on teeth. Spit and rinse. \nDone.\nSystems are just a collection of decisions. They can be linear, like brushing your teeth, where there's a series of steps that are performed in order to accomplish a task. Or they can be much more complex with multiple processes intersecting and branching out.\nAll Systems Are Opinionated\nIt's easy to feel like some systems give you lots of freedom and control, but unless you've built the system entirely yourself, you probably don't have as much influence or control as you think.\nThat's not inherently a bad thing, but the fact remains that systems can hide their opinions. In a social context, that can be harmful to minorities, for example, if a system oppresses them but is designed to hide that oppression from &quot;the majority.&quot;\nIt can also be beneficial: technical, complex systems have so much underneath the surface that one person can't even comprehend all of it. Science and technology are always built on the foundation of knowledge set before. \nWe didn't go straight from making fires to making airplanes. Each tool, each discovery becomes hidden under layers of innovation and iteration. \nDecisions were made about how computers would work, how programming languages would layer on top of and interact with &quot;machine code.&quot; All of those opinions driving how we build or use a website, a digital product, a streaming service.\nWhere Does This Become Scary?\nMost of the opinions and decisions baked into our technology and scientific knowledge are helpful and probably safe. We owe everything we have to everyone who came before us.\nSocial Systems\nSocial systems are an obvious reason to be scared of the &quot;blackbox&quot; of intentional oppression of minority groups. How terrifying to realize that seemingly innocent things you've said or done have caused harm to another.\nIt may be even more terrifying to realize that you can't do much to change the system. That doesn't mean you shouldn't do everything you possibly can. It does mean that you will rarely see the fruits of your efforts.\nWe owe it to the next generation to pass on better thinking, better policy, better awareness of the problems we've discovered in our systems. One node can't change the whole system, but many nodes absolutely can.\nDigital Systems\nWe put a lot of trust in the companies with which we interact online. I have to trust that my email sign-up form correctly and appropriately documents your consent to receive this newsletter. I have to trust that my blog template was designed to be accessible.\nThese are mild concerns compared to services that store personal information like SSNs, addresses, phone numbers, or health-related information.\nIt is a relief when certain processes have been so simplified that all of the decision-making has been done behind the scenes. But it always makes me wonder what's really happening.\nIf I could just see through the curtain to double-check the things that are important to me...

This Is What Happened.", "category": "Newsletters", "href": "/newsletters/ive-used-obsidian-for-over-a-year-this-is-what-happened/", "body": "A year with Obsidian transformed scattered notes into a powerful \"second brain,\" enhancing productivity and clarity. \u00b6 Work can teach you so many random things and most of it can be really useful. If it\u2019s not captured or directly applied, though, it\u2019s easy to forget these things.\nProductivity tips, expertise, theories, axioms, stories, strategies. I\u2019ve been lost in a mess of random sticky notes, loose papers, and Google Docs all containing these little nuggets of wisdom gained from my coworkers.\nI needed something to clean up both my physical and digital spaces. I needed a \u201csecond brain\u201d system like I\u2019d heard about from Tiago Forte.\nWhen I downloaded Obsidian, I had no idea how much this would help me...\nSecond Brain?\nThe concept is that with all of the information we deal with daily, we are no longer biologically capable of retaining it all effectively. A \u201csecond brain\u201d is a way to \u201cdownload\u201d all of that knowledge from your real brain to a digital brain.\nDavid Allen said it well: Your brain is for having ideas, not holding them.\nBTW, even though this whole email is obviously about Obsidian, a lot of this is still applicable to whatever Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) technology you use.\nTrying out the Tech\nIt was a mixed experience at first. I had been using Notion to hold my notes, but I couldn\u2019t stick to it.\nObsidian was so much more loose\u2014it didn\u2019t require as much structure or setup. I could just create a file and leave it alone. No folders needed\u2014Obsidian promised to keep track of it.\nFull disclosure, I still created some folders, but even now, I try not to create any others. I might be able to get rid of some now that I have a better handle on Obsidian\u2019s powerful way of organizing without needing folders.\nMy Obsidian Folder Structure\nI actually really loved how easy it was to jot something random down. The problem is I over-complicated it at the start.\nAttempting Zettelkasten\n\u201cZettelkasten\u201d is a term that gets thrown around in the Obsidian community a lot. It\u2019s a system of note taking designed by Niklas Luhman to help him capture knowledge and produce something with that knowledge\u2014namely books and articles.\nObsidian can absolutely be your digital zettelkasten, but it\u2019s too overwhelming to start with in my experience.\nRealizing that this was killing my momentum, I abandoned zettelkasten and just started pumping out notes whenever I could. It became easier to turn to, and then something amazing happened.\nPassing the Threshold\nOnce I had a hundred notes or so, the power of Obsidian became apparent. Ideas started flowing when I opened random notes and made connections to other notes.\nOverwhelm at work started to be suppressed the more I recorded my wins, my stats, my processes.\nEven the practice of going through my notes for a little bit of time each week became stress-relieving. Almost like an active meditation\u2014and it was productive at the same time!\nFinally, Obsidian was making good on its promise of being a second brain. It is my personal, searchable, visualized vault of knowledge that I rely on daily.\nReporting\nHere\u2019s a good example: At our company, we have a department meeting every quarter to go over everyone\u2019s \u201cOKRs\u201d and how we did for last quarter. An OKR is just a point of focus (\u201cobjective\u201d) for the quarter with \u201ckey results\u201d attached to it.\nWe have no good systems in place for the more \u201ccreative\u201d positions\u2014yes, I count developers as part of that group. There aren\u2019t great stats to report on like a marketer would have\u2014I have no idea how my code directly affects the cost or revenue of a business\nInstead of numbers of leads, I report on innovation with our site\u2014new features for editing, new pages built, updates to the design system.\nLast year, I created a system using Obsidian to capture these \u201cinnovations\u201d for the day. Then I collected them at the month level, then the quarter and year levels.\nI now had a semi-automated personal dashboard that displayed all of my accomplishments for a given time period.\nQ1 personal OKRs with embedded &quot;windows&quot; to my monthly collections of accomplishments\nIt made reporting exceptionally easy.\nSecond Brain Systems\nThere is so much to capture from our human experiences. Compounded by all of the knowledge we\u2019ve gained or want to retain, it can be overwhelming.\nStarting to systematize your \u201cbrain\u201d with notes, references, experiences, procedures, etc. will help tame some of the chaos. Here are my suggestions:\n1. Start\u2014setup is not starting. Doing anything now is better than trying to predict how you\u2019ll use something in the future. Don\u2019t let \u201csetting things up\u201d be your excuse to procrastinate.\n2. Take notes on anything and everything. Don\u2019t worry about length or perfection, at the least, these are simply reminders of ideas you\u2019ve had or things you\u2019ve wanted to explore.\n3. Set some time for processing. I try to spend an hour a week looking at the notes in my system. I\u2019ll fix the typos, add sources, create links to other notes with similar ideas, or expand the thoughts.\nLike I mentioned earlier, the great thing about Obsidian as a second brain system is that it\u2019s really simple and you can get started with zero organization, barely any setup. The sooner you get to the notes, the faster they will start to impact you.\nIt is a bit of a mindset shift from \u201ctraditional\u201d note taking, but I haven\u2019t found anything close that has both increased my productivity AND reduced my stress at the same time.\nHave I convinced you to give Obsidian a try? ;)\nThis is not at all sponsored, I\u2019m just in love with this free tool. If you do download it and try it out, I\u2019d love to know your thoughts. Hit \u201creply\u201d on this email and tell me!\nP.S. I've heard some great feedback from fellow CYBORGS that I should provide some more help with getting started in Obsidian, so I'm working on a Quickstart Guide that I'll send out next week, as well as a quick video series to show you my process.

Or can it deceive us as well as an AI-generated photo? The role of truth in art. \u00b6 I entered the classroom convinced this particular class would be one of the most boring that I had to take in my college career: History of Photography.\nMy professor quickly dismantled that concern and we dove into some really unexpected arguments about what photography is at its core\u2014philosophically, even.\nPhotos are supposed to be truth-tellers. In many ways, they are, and in many ways they are not.\nPeople are inclined to believe photos and videos, because they capture the world the same way we see it with our eyes. However, they are easily manipulated\u2014and in the context of over 200 years of having the camera, I'm not just talking about images getting Photoshopped or AI-generated (though that'll be discussed later).\nTruth and Story\nStory is possibly the oldest human tool. It propels knowledge and wisdom down through generations. It transforms and influences behavior. It has more of an impact than we may ever know\u2014the products we buy, the people with whom we associate, the decisions we make, all have to do with stories.\nWe can be told stories, but we also tell ourselves stories.\nThe camera accomplishes both. It is produced by someone who is trying to tell a story, and the product (the photo or video) encourages us as viewers to tell ourselves a story\u2014an influenced story.\nThe paradox is uncovered: stories can be true, even if they are manipulated.\nFor example, Alexander Gardner photographed scenes from the aftermath of battles in the U.S. Civil War in the mid-19th century. Alexander posed the corpse in the photograph, &quot;Home of a Rebel Sharpshooter, Gettysburg.&quot;\nOther photographers have done similar things: manipulating the scene to, technically, better capture the story.\nJust because a photograph or the setting itself has been manipulated, doesn't mean it's deliberately false. It might even tell more of the truth.\nYou, as the viewer, can't really know what's outside of the frame\u2014and that's so important to understand.\nTruth and AI\nIt's been said that as of 2023, validation via content is no longer possible. Things like video, voice, publicly-known details about your life are now replicable or accessible by AI. \nWhat is truth if we can no longer trust anything?\nI console myself by thinking, &quot;we can focus on our skills at detecting suspicious activity,&quot; though I know this is ultimately insufficient. AI pits all of humanity's skills against a single person's skills, and therefore, we will lose every time.\nRegulation and restraint will become exceedingly important ingredients for systemic safety.\nThat does not absolve ourselves from the need to develop those skills. Here are some of the skills we'll need to build up and encourage\u2014especially in younger generations:\n\nTemperance. Knowing that headlines and short quips perform best when they incite fear or anger, we need to be wary of those tactics. When you see yourself responding to something emotionally, take a step back and give yourself space to process and think through what is really happening. Am I being manipulated? Is this biased? Can I disprove this logically?\nCross-reference. Always question the validity first before we believe the headline. How many times have you actually read the article and checked the sources for some news or opinion or assertion? This was vital before AI was injected into our systems and content. It is inexcusable to not do now.\nTry to have conversations with real people. If you are seeing something that truly has rattled you, it's time to go offline. Talk to people in your community, your network in real life. Talking with real people makes you accountable for what you say and helps you process more effectively. What are the implications of what you've seen? How does it impact people who aren't in your same situation? How can we find a better way forward? Is there really any truth to this? It's important to have these conversations, but I'd encourage you to try and talk with people who don't see everything the same way as you do, so we don't re-create the echo chamber that we were trying to avoid by going offline.\n\nI do believe that humans are capable of solving complex problems. Some of these problems have been with us from the beginning: What is truth? Who do we trust?\nTruth and Art\nTechnology has increased the scale of some of our worst behaviors: bullying, disinformation (meaning, intentional deception), rage, discrimination. We are able to hide behind anonymity and screens. We continuously feed machines with our attention and the machines learn what best keeps that attention and encourages engagement.\nNone of that is truth. I don't believe that humanity is inherently inclined to behave this way to each other\u2014but the depersonalization of screens and text and the added pull of algorithms has elicited this.\nWhat about art is different? Art\u2014real art\u2014is transformative; sometimes uncomfortable; sometimes inspiring.\nArt is an attempt to reach through barriers and expose more truth\u2014maybe even truth we couldn't see before. Art is opinionated and intentionally created.\nIt stands as a contrast to the digital worlds we're enveloped in. It is human. It is powerful. It tries to shine light where technology would have us hide.\nIt may not always be truth in the sense of perfectly captured reality\u2014but that's never been possible anyway. \nI think art is a way to connect with people you wouldn't have otherwise, because it digs deep into the human experience. I think art is our closest tool for communicated truth.\nAgain, that does not absolve us from thinking critically and using the exact same skills we need to use on news outlets and social media, on the art that we view, read, hear, or experience. I simply believe that art is our last untouched venue for attempting to play the truth-telling game. \n(I'm quite aware that AI can create imagery. I made this video to explore what I think is actually happening.)

Thousands of us stood in the chilly night air, anticipation rising. The temporary platform lights flickered on, a crunchy guitar started to rumble out a tune while the drums pulsed in the audience\u2019s chests.\nIt was the first time I had seen a professional band in a live performance. Red Jumpsuit Apparatus was one of the bands I connected with in my 20s and I couldn\u2019t believe they would come to this random college in the mountains.\nI had turned to music to try and process my depression. If nothing else, music helped me feel something amidst the constant darkness and sorrow. Chills ran through every nerve ending as I heard some of my favorite songs performed right there in front of me.\nHumanity\nHumanity tends to be a hard thing for me to nail down. At times it seems to refer to the best we have to offer as people, and other times, it\u2019s about our worst.\nWhat I often lean towards are the feelings I get in certain experiences or settings. Going to that concert was one. If you\u2019ve ever been to a concert or even an open mic venue, you\u2019re not guaranteed to get the \u201cbest\u201d musicians, but it sometimes feels like you do anyway.\nWe all listen to music virtually\u2014on our phones, YouTube, streaming services, radio, etc. But it\u2019s the live performance that brings something unique. It brings out the chills on our spine, it brings out the emotions, the thrills, the sadness, the connection.\nThat\u2019s humanity.\nTechnology\nTechnology is the application of knowledge\u2014it\u2019s what we make or do with what we know.\nWhere humans bring warmth and flexibility, tech brings coolness and rigidity. But it\u2019s exceptionally useful to us. It can be fun, frightening, or fulfilling.\nWhile we love our technology, I think we all have underlying suspicions, doubts, and negativity about it. In some ways, technology has exploited our humanity, and in other ways, it has extended it.\nWe all have problems that we run into, and we can\u2019t help but use or invent solutions.\nThat\u2019s technology.\nWisdom\nHow do we harmonize these two things? (Besides reading this newsletter \ud83d\ude0f)\nI\u2019ve often heard \u201cwisdom\u201d defined as, \u201cknowledge, applied,\u201d but that\u2019s more of what \u201ctechnology\u201d actually is. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good argument to solely appeal to the dictionary, but, all of the dictionary entries I\u2019ve seen for \u201cwisdom\u201d include this keyword: \u201cjudgment.\u201d\nI think that\u2019s our clue for extending our humanity with our technology. Judgment is how we force ourselves to act and decide even when the temptation to not act or decide is actively pulling us (usually through our tech).\nJudgment is how we know when to do this. Judgment is our testing tool\u2014both before and after a decision. Wisdom comes from making those judgments, acting with those decisions, and examining the outcome of the whole ordeal.\nObviously, wisdom is not gained from an email or an article or a social media thread. I\u2019d venture to say we all think of wisdom as being higher quality and value than knowledge. However, it is so rare in the face of all of the knowledge to which we have access.\nSo, how does this work? I\u2019m still working this out myself, but I think I have found a few insights that will help:\n\nIf we want to survive technology (foreshadowing to a future CYBORG_ issue), wisdom must become the goal over and above our thirst for knowledge.\nWisdom is uniquely human.\nWisdom requires experience, which means it\u2019s hard to gain and must be accompanied by failures along the way.\nRestraint and self-sacrifice appear to be necessary components.\nIt may not be scalable.\n\nThe paradox lies in #1 and #5 of the above list. Wisdom must be our ultimate goal in order to preserve humanity, but technology is scalable where wisdom likely can\u2019t be.\nIt\u2019s an impossible problem. Or at least, it feels that way.\nBut, ultimately, and despite all of my fears and doubts about humanity, I do know one thing: you matter. Individuals can create changes outsized of themselves. And when many individuals take up the call to do what\u2019s right, humanity is the most beautiful thing to witness.

How I've tried reducing stress and building credibility in high-stakes environments. \u00b6 You've been writing this email for weeks. Constant changes from stakeholders. It's a big campaign for an event going out to some important customers. You've checked and re-checked links and read through the email.\nThe cursor is hovering over the &quot;Send&quot; button, but you're shaking. Sweat beading on your forehead. Do it. Ok now, do it. Come on.\nFinally you hit &quot;Send&quot; because your finger had a spasm that added just enough pressure to make the click.\n&quot;It's off,&quot; you say to yourself quietly disguised as a sigh.\nYou look at the email one more time and there at the bottom, in a glaring spotlight is a typo\u2014it's the wrong date for the event!! \ud83d\ude31\nSpotlights\nTechnology has a way of capturing, surfacing, and amplifying our mistakes. What you publish becomes searchable and traceable all the way back to you.\nWe get called out in comments or your boss checks in on your social media. Work-related publishing can feel like it's all you, because even if the public doesn't know who made the mistake, your manager will know who was in charge of the project.\nManagers always know who to blame \ud83d\ude05\nThe thing about mistakes is that the vast majority of the time, they're blown way out of proportion in our minds due to the spotlight effect. Psych 1010 tells us that we think people are noticing us way more than they actually are. It's a bias, and it's usually wrong.\nIn my experience, there are a few ways we can overcome the spotlight effect, transform our devastation into something we can handle, and ultimately, get more comfortable making mistakes in public.\n'Cause let's be real, on the Internet, someone's always watching...\n\nTwo Choices\nAs a developer, I'm responsible for anything and everything related to website breakdowns. Something looks off in the design or something won't load. The worst, though, is when I do something that breaks a whole page (or the whole site...I mean, that never actually happens...)\nI've tried two different approaches.\nHide Everything\nLike a kid who breaks something in the house, I've tried simply flying under the radar by discovering bugs and fixing them before anyone notices.\nI'm not going to get away with the massive breaks, but on the small, fast stuff, this still kinda works. I am doing my job by monitoring things and randomly checking pages\u2014if I see something, I fix it.\nI have always tried to make a record of things I find and fix, but I don't bother telling people about it. If they want to know what I did for 15 minutes on Friday the 13th, they can look it up in the project management software.\nShow Everything\nThis is where we break through the spotlight effect. It's no longer a bias\u2014we're actually going to shine the real spotlight on ourselves.\nI had a pretty bad bug a few months ago that took down a page on the website. I immediately started on a fix, but I have to wait for a &quot;deployment&quot; to run for the fix to go live. It takes a couple of hours to push through the whole process, and it's only a couple of minutes of manual work during the time.\nWhile I was waiting, I realized I had a choice. I could try and fly under the radar and risk being called out by someone finally noticing. Or I could get in front of it and be the one that shines the light on it.\nIt's counter-intuitive to me to expose my mistakes. I don't want to be punished\u2014and there are real risks for doing this, let's be real here.\nHowever, in a healthy work environment, being the one who announces the problem has actually increased the trust others have in me.\nThe Framework\nWhen you shine the light on a problem, you need to do the following:\n\nDescribe the problem. The products page is showing a 500 error.\nDescribe the cause. This was related to the new feature we added to the solution page, but it had a typo in the connection.\nHow long was this a problem? I found this at 1 PM today, so it's only been about 20 minutes.\nWhat are you already doing about the problem? I have a fix that is on track to go live in 75 minutes.\nDescribe any next steps. I'll let you know as soon as the deployment finishes and the page is back up.\nIs there anything else you need to solve the problem? If you can keep the marketing team from sending the email update until after the page is back up, I'd appreciate that.\n\nThis framework keeps things short, provides clear information about what happened, where we are currently, and what's next. These are the questions anyone will have when they hear there is a problem.\n\nPro Tip:\nIf you're the kind of person that likes to hit Send for each line of a message in a chat program, don't do that here. You don't want to send a single line saying, &quot;This page is broken.&quot;\nSend it all at once\u2014the problem, the fix, the plan. This reduces anxiety for your coworkers.\n\nWhat I love about this framework is that &quot;I'm so sorry&quot; is not found anywhere in the message. Crunch time is not the time for apologies and self-deprecation. Instead this shows that you are in control and you are leading out on fixing a problem.\nThat's not to say that apologizing is bad. I just tend to over-apologize and that prevents me from making progress when I really need to focus.\nSpeaking of apologizing...\nTransparency Increases Trust\nThere is one more counter-intuitive thing that companies especially struggle with. \nPublic apologies are tough. They feel embarrassing, they feel awkward, they shine that white-hot spotlight on something you'd prefer stayed hidden.\nCompanies hate apologizing. People think that apologizing shows weakness, so decision-makers in business tend not apologize.\nHowever, there are examples of brands owning up to their mistakes and it ends up increasing trust in the brand. (I'm thinking about Toyota in the early 2000's, Netflix, and others)\nAnecdotally, I just can't trust a person, a politician, a company, an organization that refuses to apologize when they've made a mistake.\nThe hardest part is being seen, mistakes and all. It's risky, it's painful, but it's almost always better to own the mistakes. We can't remove mistakes, so we may as well aim for removing as much shame as possible instead.

Our complex relationship with obedient technology. \u00b6 I sometimes feel like stories and movies are a suspension of reality\u2014an escape, an exploration. When it comes to AI, I was particularly convinced it was all ridiculous fantasy. Until I heard a mythologist explain how the lore we've developed about AI over time has and will continue to impact the designers of this technology. \nMovies, particularly, have wide reach across fields. We're actually fooling ourselves to assume that we can disregard the outlandish Sci-Fi plots, warnings, and design features of artificial intelligence. \nAfter all, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI (creators of ChatGPT), admitted that the movie, Her, &quot;certainly more than a little bit inspired us.&quot; We can speculate that the lawsuit Scarlet Johansson filed against OpenAI for using what sure sounded like her as ChatGPT's voice when the feature first launched is potentially a nod to that &quot;inspiration.&quot;\nTo explore this, I'm going to send out a CYBORG_ issue every once-in-a-while that examines an AI movie and how the themes impact us right here and now. We'll kick things off with a brand new, 2024 film called, &quot;Subservience.&quot; I'll do my best not to include any spoilers, and if you haven't seen the movie, you should still be able to follow along!\nBreakdown\nOne of the most prominent choices for storytelling about AI in this movie was to have the Al robot extremely human-like. Complete with a UV light to kill bacteria in the robot's mouth so they don't have to brush their teeth, meaning that the robot is housed in flesh-like conditions that would require addressing bacteria...\nObviously, the human actress, Megan Fox, is already human and therefore leans on previously established tropes and mannerisms to appear more robotic: unsynchronized head and body turns, stiff posture, smaller range of vocal inflections, etc.\nWhat we might miss, though is the implied design choice made by the robot manufacturers in this world. This actually matters a lot and has potentially devastating impacts beyond the clich\u00e9 &quot;bugs in the machine&quot; plot.\nNatural interactions\nOne positive feature of this design is that you already know what to do with a human. There's no need for on-boarding or an interface. If you don't already know what an Alexa device is and how to use it, you're still going to need a little bit of training. It's about as minimal of a design as it gets, but that doesn't mean it's obvious what to do with it.\nFamily / home tasks\nThis is most likely the best reason a robot would look like a human: taking care of children. I would guess it's more natural for very young children to understand and accept a caretaker that appears human. Again, leaning on a baby or child's natural instincts to overcome the potential barriers to trust the robot.\nCorporate motivations\nWe have an awkward plot point where an entire team of construction workers are replaced by bots. These aren't special bots with built-in tools or different designs optimized for construction. They look just like humans. \nThis is a slap in the face, because it demonstrates the company's motivations: cost reduction. It's not about safety, speed, or quality. If it were, they'd opt for a truly radical upgrade to robots specialized to the unique needs of construction work. Instead, the company is choosing the less effective strategy: cutting the easy costs. \nNo more need for human needs like food, breaks, and other decent working conditions. AND we don't have to buy new tools like drills and screwdrivers. Simply replace the operator.\nThis is where we find the most nefarious parts of the AI-housed-in-a-human-body design choice, and in my opinion reflects the real concerns we should have with the introduction of AI into the workplace: greed. Yes, some jobs are literally threatened by AI, and that hurts. Even worse is a board of executives deciding that the people they previous employed are mere objects that can be replaced by other slightly upgraded objects.\nSlavery\nPerhaps I was primed by the title of this movie; maybe it was the overt sexual interactions between owner and machine; and it might be the image of the robot standing in the corner while the family eats dinner at the table. Slavery was the dominant theme that clouded everything I saw in the movie.\nI don't see a world where AI truly becomes self-aware and sentient\u2014as I've explained in a previous CYBORG_, we have a cognitive bias that would erroneously ascribe life to the inanimate. Despite our biases and cognitive traps, I'm still repulsed by the idea that we could become comfortable with this style of robotic slavery.\nAgain, not because it has anything to do with the robot itself, but because we would opt for a human-like servant to be at our beck and call. What would it do to us to train ourselves that it's ok to treat human-looking creatures like servants? How would our behavior towards the obvious humanoid robot spill over to real people that we don't like? How would we start treating real humans that we see as beneath us?\nWould slavery and servitude return as the only option for unskilled or manual labor? For the people who can't afford a human-like robot, maybe it would become acceptable to grab another human. Maybe a child.\nHuman history clearly shows us that humans can't be trusted. We're too easily tempted by power and greed to allow a complex intelligence be housed in the skin of a human and not become a training tool for exploitation of actual humans.\nCreating robots that can serve as a sex object, a cook, a babysitter, and an assistant with any number of other tasks is wildly irresponsible, and it is ultimately a future that is in the realm of possibility for us right now. We'll have to raise our voices for better legislation, thoughtful restrictions and standards for our AI researchers and developers. It is possible to change the future here in the present.\nReal-World Robots\nIn 2014, Savioke Labs was trying to finish Relay, a robot to help with hotel delivery services like bringing towels and snacks to guests.\nThey were worried about this robot being creepy in the eyes of guests, so they went through a rigorous week of research, prototyping, and testing. The book, &quot;Sprint,&quot; by Jake Knapp described their process, and included this concern from Steve Cousins, CEO &amp; founder of Savioke:\n&quot;We're all spoiled by C-3PO and WALL-E. We expect robots to have feelings and plans, hopes and dreams. Our robot is just not that sophisticated. If guests talk to it, it's not going to talk back. And if we disappoint people, we're sunk.&quot;\nInterestingly enough, based on the prototypes and tests in this final &quot;Sprint&quot; week, they had great feedback for giving the robot just a tiny bit of personality: a digital &quot;face&quot; and a few actions that appeared to express happiness, like a little dance or some chirping noises.\n&quot;Guest after guest responded the same way. They were enthusiastic when they first saw the robot...People wanted to call the robot back to make a second delivery, just so they could see it again...But no one, not one person, tried to engage the robot in any conversation.&quot;\nEven though this was 10 years ago, we can see a few principles that indicate the difference in human interactions. The Savioke robot is not at all humanoid. It's more like an elegant box that glides across the floor like a Roomba. The people who interacted with it had no expectations of treating it like a human by trying to talk to it. They didn't even have many options of things they could do with it. \nContrasted with the highly advanced, but human-looking models from Subservience, we see humans enraged by robots (such as the waiters in the diners/bars in the film), we see the main character overcome by sexual desire despite it being against his values, we see poor behavior of human-to-human interactions especially when loyalty is challenged.\nCyborg\nThere is space for robots to enrich our lives, but it is the design of the robots that will have drastically different outcomes.\nAs we watch technology progress, we need to be even more vigilant in living by our values and choosing carefully what technology is allowed to touch in our lives.\nMy wife reminds me frequently not to yell at Alexa, because I don't want to be the kind of person that yells at something/someone (much as I get frustrated by Amazon attempting to upsell me, bio-hack me, or order something on my behalf). I'm trying to use this primitive robot / intelligence to train myself to extend respect to all things\u2014human and other\u2014while still drawing boundaries around what I will allow Alexa access to or what I choose to offload to it.\nWe also need to examine our psychology. We need to not let our proclivity to animate soul-less objects distract us from the real and impactful issues at hand. Spend less time wondering about whether a robot has feelings (because it doesn't, for now) and spend more time scrutinizing the companies that are getting exceptionally wealthy off of your information and your attention.

At my company we call it a Quarterly Business Review (QBR) and I had traditionally struggled to report on my work due to its creative and agency-like nature.\nObviously, it's important to put your best foot forward at these kinds of reviews. You can set yourself up for better compensation and better opportunities when your report is impressive, but how and what do you track to accomplish this?\nBefore we get into the weeds, I do recognize not everybody is able to have the autonomy or authority to set their own goals or even report on their own progress. However, I think these principles and techniques will still give you a base of information that you can use when the opportunity arises\u2014even if it's just beefing up your LinkedIn profile.\nTrack Everything\nDon't report on everything, but do try to track everything.\nBusiness people love data. Understandably so, because it makes us feel secure since we can point to numbers and say &quot;That bad&quot; and &quot;That good.&quot;\nSome positions, however, are really difficult to quantify in a meaningful way. What if you're a graphic designer? Reporting on the number of images you exported is a really bad way to show your value. \nThe quantity and sometimes the quality of work doesn't matter as much as the business outcome that your work contributes to. \nTracking your work is just for you. It helps you identify the patterns that you can interpret and express to show your value and uncover problems that the team needs to be aware of.\nWe don't always know what metrics might be needed as we're working day to day, so I've tried to use &quot;track everything,&quot; as a reminder to take notes on my work, record differences (before and after I did something), and highlight special tasks completed.\nHere are a few things I like to track:\n\nTime it takes to do a task manually (before you automate), and time it takes after you automate.\nDetails that highlight quality or craftsmanship\u2014the stuff people only notice when you don't do it.\n&quot;Testimonials&quot; or praise that another team member gives you, if it's specific to a project or task.\nNumber of tasks received vs. completed.\nWhat kind of tasks are received? How many of those are &quot;interruptions&quot;?\nUsage data for the software I create for the team. (How much is my tool being used? How many people are using it?)\n\nReporting = Data + Story\nObviously, this comes with nuance depending on your job, and I am of course, not implying that you should embellish, hide, or otherwise deceive people as you report on your work. However, there are a few common traps I've seen even experienced professionals fall into, as well as a few tips to make your data go further.\nDon't report on &quot;time&quot;\nThe idea that your time is what is valuable puts you in a terrible position. Freelancers deal with this when they use hourly billing models for their work. No one cares how much time something took\u2014in fact, framing an outcome in &quot;time spent&quot; makes you sound like an expense, and we don't want to be viewed in this light. We want to be viewed as either an investment or profit.\nIf all you have right now are time metrics, consider reframing it in terms of time saved. Even better, don't mention time, simply mention efficiencies: &quot;We removed the friction for XYZ process, which helped us increase our output by 12%.&quot;\nIt's worth doing some math and tracking as much as you can to get out of time-based reporting. Businesses and bosses care about making more money or saving on costs. Unless you've been given other parameters that the business cares about regarding your work, figure out how you've contributed to the business machine of profits and savings.\nDon't report on everything\nChoose your most impactful stats or outcomes and stop sharing while you're ahead.\nLast year, I was demonstrating something to a team and heard audible gasps from the other Zoom profiles. &quot;That's amazing\u2014show me more!&quot; \nI hadn't prepared more to show, because I had limited time in the meeting, but I made the mistake of indulging them and it tanked my presentation. Never go past the &quot;sale,&quot; leave them wanting more.\nThere's also a danger when you overshare: people get bored, distracted, or tired. Having lots to report on feels like a good thing to you, but it's almost always better to show restraint and respect for time by pulling out the highlights and making that data really digestable.\nUse the &quot;before and after&quot; framework.\nPeople can't help but be intrigued when you provide two things to compare. It puts abstract data in context, and it encourages the viewer to engage since they'll take a moment to consider the original state with the new state.\nThink weight loss photos. You may see someone in the middle of their journey and it may not seem like they've accomplished anything. Seeing where they started suddenly puts their current progress in context and makes even smaller numbers appear more impressive.\nStory\nData always needs story to be effective. Even data-people know that you have to add commentary to the data for people to understand what it means.\nTell your story and use the data you have to provide the evidence for the story.\nReporting Through Notes at Work\nI take my notes in Obsidian, but any software will work (just make sure you follow any policies your company may have). I've stolen an idea from a YouTuber, whose name I've long forgotten (sorry), but I've made some changes to his original system to be a little easier to report and track things throughout the quarter and the year.\nFor the visual learners, I recorded a live (unedited) breakdown of this system so you can see how it works (10 minutes). \nExclusive CYBORG_ Subscriber content!\nhttps://youtu.be/G5ZG3OKJTbc\nHere's the gist of how I do this:\nDaily\nWe start with the Daily Note, which in Obsidian can be automatically opened each day, and can be templated with the following headings:\n\nOutcomes\n(Special Interest / Goal)\nNotes\n\nIn my case, I use the heading &quot;Accessibility&quot; as my second, special interest heading, because I want to track the above-and-beyond efforts to fix or improve accessibility on my websites.\nWhen I have achieved something note-worthy during the work day, I throw a quick bullet point under the &quot;Outcomes&quot; heading or the &quot;Special Interest&quot; heading if it's relevant.\nI use the Notes section for any meetings or things I need to jot down in the moment\u2014it's my &quot;scratch paper&quot; section that will probably never be looked at again. If there is something useful in the Notes section, I'll highlight those parts and move them into a real note file.\nThe highlights at the top of the note are the most important part of the daily note. These will be brought into other notes as we progress through the system.\nMonthly\nThis is where you collect all of the highlights and outcomes that you identified in your daily notes. Obsidian allows you to embed notes by heading so it makes this really easy to build a little dashboard for the month.\nIf you are using Obsidian, here's how you add an embedded link that shows only a specific heading (&quot;Outcomes&quot;) and its contents:\n![[2024-09-17#Outcomes]]\n\nNow that we have the highlights from our daily notes together in this month-view, we can prune it down to the most impactful outcomes.\n![[Monthly Overview Example.png]]\nThe Monthly template also has the same headings as the Daily template, but this time, they're sourced from the embedded content above them.\nAt the end of the month, I'll make sure all of the daily notes with either outcomes or special-interest content are pulled into the month file. Then I look through each outcome and copy and paste them into the Monthly Outcomes section, rewording or editing as needed.\nNot every outcome matters to everyone, so keep in mind whoever it is that you need to report to, and use their goals and expectations as a measuring stick to leave out or include any of your outcome summaries.\nNext, do the same thing with the Special Interest section: Pull from the highlights, include or edit them to be as clear and impactful as possible.\nOptionally, you can add these headings to the Monthly template:\n\nDecisions\nSuggestions for Improvement\n\nWhen I'm working on larger projects, there are major decisions I make in the moment. Maybe the design just doesn't work on mobile the way it was mocked up. Maybe we realized as a team that the URL structure needed to be modified for better SEO and information architecture.\nThese decisions are easy to remember in the context of the project, but they easily fade as new projects take your full attention. Having a place where you can record these high-impact decisions might be helpful. Not only for reporting, but sometimes to de-escalate an argument with all of the reasons why the decision needed to be made. (I don't know why that last part was important to point out, devs never fight about the best way to do things...lol).\nSuggestions for improvement is also helpful at the monthly level for me, because usually day-to-day there aren't that many problems or team issues. However, I'm asked for suggestions frequently in one-on-one meetings with my manager, performance reviews, and even our QBRs. Having this on hand helps me note the problem right when it's relevant, and encourages me to think through a potential solution before bringing it up.\nQuarterly\nThe quarterly template is essentially the same as the monthly template. This time, we're compiling all of the curated highlights for Outcomes and Special Interests from the three months in the quarter.\nWe'll repeat the same process of pruning, now that we're looking for the most impactful outcomes for the quarter.\nThings that are crucial, keep in the Quarterly Outcomes. Things that you like, but that aren't especially compelling are still recorded for you in the monthly template.\nYearly\nThis obviously is a repeat of the process, but now pulling in the Quarterly headings. \nI was absolutely stunned to see my 2024 Yearly note after going through this process yesterday.

In my last performance review, she was astonished that I even had a couple of quotes from team members regarding a project I had done.\n&quot;That's cool, Jess! You even got quotes in there. How are you so on top of everything?&quot; Tags: "}, {"title": "Tool Time", "category": "Newsletters", "href": "/newsletters/tool-time/", "body": "From bullwhips to AI\u2014how tools require wisdom, not just access, and why understanding your problem is real key to building the right solution. \u00b6 Six years ago, I became obsessed with an ancient tool that I just couldn't get to work.\nIn a race to accomplish various challenges with hundreds of other people, one of the tasks was to pop a balloon with a bullwhip. \nI loved Indiana Jones growing up (original trilogy only...), so I figured my raw skill and observation would be enough. How hard could it be?\nVery hard.\nI spent so much time on that station, trying different, random ways to fling the whip at the balloon on the post. \nIt was scary\u2014whips feel like they have their own will, because the tiniest motion can send everything flailing. It was frustrating.\nAfter the race, I left with a determination to figure out the whip.\nTools\nMost technology eventually is manifested in the form of tools. The more we learn, the more problems we encounter, the more deficits our human body has for the task at hand, the more we lean on or create tools.\nThe better the tool, the easier we can accomplish the task...mostly.\nThe catch is that tools don't magically make you better at using the tool or even solving the problem the tool is made for. \nSome tools require training, special safety gear, or even deep expertise just to use. The whip is a dangerous tool that can hurt others near the whip and the one holding the whip. \nIf you don't know what you're doing, you can seriously hurt yourself. \n\n    \n    Proper technique: A loop forms and travels all the way down the whip until it cracks at the very end.\n\nAt an Indiana Jones themed party, I was asked to bring my whip and teach people who wanted to try. Most people got the hang of it pretty fast when they followed my cues on the technique. \nThere was one person who didn't want to listen to my coaching. \nHe tried so hard to demonstrate his strength that he ended up with huge welts all over his back, because he refused to consider technique (and refused to stop injuring himself over and over again). He was literally whipping himself.\nSome problems require intricate, careful use of the tool. For example, once I put in the time to learn to crack the whip, I still couldn't pop balloons with it consistently.\nThat was still a huge improvement over the &quot;never&quot; result I had gotten in that original race, but it's not enough to say I have mastered the skill.\nAfter spending lots of time with the tool, learning as much as I can about technique and the mechanics, I have been able to slice through a chicken egg with my whip a few times now:\n\n    \n    Chicken egg exploding from contact with the whip.\n\nTool Building\nIt's nice to find a tool to solve a problem. It's enthralling to build a tool to solve a problem.\nTool-building is the skill I see becoming ever more relevant and important at work and in digital spaces. \nIn order to build a tool to solve a problem, you need two things:\n\nDeep knowledge of the problem\nThe skills to build the tool\n\nUnderstanding the problem is the most important part. A lot of problems effectively disappear once you know, truly, what they are. The ones that stick around are the problems you probably need tools to solve.\nThe skills you'll need to build tools scale with the complexity of the problem you're solving. Don't dismay, though! Coding, automation, and other forms of tool-building is only getting easier and more accessible.\nAI and no-code tools are a huge help in this process, which is why we need to divert our focus back to the first step: gaining deep knowledge of the problem.\nWithout being able to describe the problem\u2014where it comes from, how to recognize it, what it impacts, whether/how it changes, when it appears\u2014creating tools prematurely will be insufficient at best.\nFallacy\nOne word of caution is that technically, tools require some kind of wisdom. How and when to use the tools you have. Not just how to operate the tool, but how the tool is applied. \nEspecially digital tools can mask what the tool is doing or how it impacts you and others. AI is a great example. We can't know how it was trained, on what sources, and whether the way we use AI can be exploited or harmful. \nNot only that, it's tempting to stop learning the basics when you can just shortcut with an AI tool that will give you an average result.\nI suppose the only way to attack these issues is by developing the wisdom to intentionally learn the basics, learn the tool, and learn about the problems you'll use the tool to solve.\nWhen do you arrive at wisdom? The wise might say, &quot;Never.&quot;\nIt's a process you have to commit to simply because it's the right thing to do, not because you'll eventually &quot;get there.&quot;\nCyborg\nTools can only help you so much. The best tool doesn't create the best outcome, and an expert can create something great with the worst tools.\nThe point is that you continue to exercise the skills of restraint, intention, and exploration. \nWe need to develop our technical skills more deeply if we want to use technical tools. We need to develop discipline and restraint when we want to use powerful tools.\nTool building is innate. It's a way to package up knowledge gained from encountering problems and finding effective ways to solve them.\nHopefully, we're all tool-builders, it's the only way to keep up in this world. Let's just make sure we are as diligent at wisely applying our tools as we are about creating or gathering tools.\nIf you're interested in tool building, here are some ideas or guides for where you can explore:\n\nAutomate the Boring Stuff with Python\u2014this is the book that taught me python and changed the trajectory of my life and career. Highly recommended\u2014and it's free.\n[Work Automation Playlist]\u2014a range of easy to intermediate ideas for tools or techniques you can use to help with work from my tutorial channel.\nNo-code tools like Zapier and If This Then That (IFTTT) can help you create workflows or connections between apps you already have and use.

As you know, I love using Obsidian for my Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system, but I wanted to focus on some of the case studies of where PKM is useful. Platform-agnostic, bring your own system today ;)\nHere are my favorite use cases for PKM, the problems they solve, the results, and a glimpse at how you can model something similar:\nMini Essays\nProblems:\n\nScattered knowledge\nHaving references, but nothing that are your own thoughts\nNotes that aren't output- or publish-ready\n\nResults:\n\nDistilled knowledge\nPublish-worthy pieces that can be combined (e.g. a larger article, book) or as a standalone  piece (social media post, blog)\nStudy / learning tool\nImproved writing and thinking\n\nHow to do it:\nThe key here is to be very focused. Leave out the unnecessary things like the intro and conclusion unless it makes sense in your case. This isn't about word count. It's about communication.\nTry to explain a specific topic as concisely as possible. This allows you to write without losing focus and doubles as a piece that you can copy/paste into larger pieces, almost totally ready to go.\nI love how this creator described it: &quot;I write it as if I'm going to teach someone else.&quot; \nHere's the process:\n\nTake a topic or an idea that piqued your interest.\nWrite down the source(s) that contributed or are referenced\n\nCreate your detailed note about this topic:\nHow can you describe this concept quickly if you need a refresher?\nWhat impact does this idea have?\nHow does it apply to your life? Are there other applications?\nHow is it connected to other ideas or notes you've taken?\n\n\nIf it does connect to others and your system allows for linking, then wire it up so you can see where this fits in with other topics.\n\nDiscovery Notes\nProblems:\n\nHate it when I looked into something new or complex, had ideas or was starting to understanding what's going on, then I leave it for some time. When I come back to it, I have to start all over again. \nLost my place in the middle of some process\u2014what have I done? What's left to do?\n\nResults:\n\nRoadmap\nValuable for others\u2014SOPs at work or content you can share\n\nHow to do it:\nAs soon as you make progress or successfully do this new thing, document it.\nThat includes all of the mini-progress and successes along the way.\nI crack open my notes when I'm starting a new task and do a quick outline as I go:\n\nGrab URLs from articles that helped\nCopy/paste quotes or snippets from documentation\nScreenshot what the button (or whatever) looked like\nWrite down the steps I took\nWrite down any mistakes\u2014&quot;Don't do this...&quot; or &quot;Clicking XYZ before ABC will break it...&quot;\n\n\n\nExample of discovery notes turned into a troubleshooting guide for me in the future.\n\n\nThere's so much you collect, distill, and throw out in the process of learning or problem-solving. It helps to keep notes as you're making those decisions. This can become a helpful guide for you or someone else in the future.\nIt can also be a way to troubleshoot or prove what you've done if everything ultimately fails.\nReference Library\nProblems:\n\nComplex or infrequently used information is fastest to be forgotten\nFrequently used information is hard to access or to quickly pull out\nTips, tricks, and expertise aren't easily accessible\n\nResults:\n\nQuick access to snippets of information\nEasy way to store copy/paste solutions\nDocumentation of processes\u2014checklist mentality / cognitive offloading\n\nHow to do it:\nDocument your processes\u2014this might look like taking your discovery notes and finalizing them into sleek, complete steps.\nWrite down the things you look up all the time. For example, I have built up a library of code snippets that are small, accomplish something very specific, and that I use throughout my code all the time.\n\n\nExample of a reference note with some code I can copy/paste from or just model after.\n\n\nI've found the reference library is most helpful when I'm committed to always storing these kinds of notes in one place. Not on sticky notes, random Slack messages, bookmarked webpages, and emails\u2014it must get put in Obsidian so that I look for it in Obsidian.\nMedia Trace\nProblems:\n\nHow did I get to this conclusion?\nWhere did I get this opinion?\n\nResults:\n\nAble to find your sources\nAble to critique your thought process\n&quot;Genealogy&quot; of ideas, opinions, conclusions\n\nHow to do it:\nThe easiest way might be to simply add a line at the bottom of your existing notes with a short statement and a link for &quot;where this note came from.&quot; \nThis is not a bibliography, it's tracing why you got to the note you're on\u2014not the source of the current note.\nI have a snippet that adds prompts and questions to the end of a mini essay / permanent note (thanks to Vicky Zhao's video):\nThis way I can link-surf my way through my notes and remember various sources (videos, books, articles) I've gone over that lead me to where I am now. Very similar to how you might surf a website\u2014jumping from link to link.\n![[Pasted image 20240415060827.png]]\nThe other method might be to actually map it out. This could be with a Map of Content system where you have a note on a specific topic (perhaps the conclusion you came to) and then list out the sources or notes in the order you consumed them. \nYou could also use a visual map of this progress with Obsidian canvas, or any of the many drawing tools out there.\nI choose this alternate method when the order of the media matters to me\u2014whether because the knowledge needs to be built upon each step or because I want to remember that order for some reason.\nCYBORG\nUse these case studies to inspire solutions for the problems you face in your mental and digital spaces. \nA lot of these apply to knowledge work, but I've found uses for them in my personal notes as well.

You can see it in the struggle penned by many authors and script writers. In I, Robot, Will Smith's character asks Sonny the robot, Can you compose a Symphony? Paint a masterpiece?\nWith wit, Sonny asks in response: Can you?\nIt is chilling to think of the implications of losing our artistic pursuits and expression. An ever-optimized algorithmic garbage heap of junk-food style art, saturating us to the point of no longer experiencing real art.\nDoom and gloom is not yet, however. I think we still have time to draw boundaries, claim the roles and responsibilities that are uniquely ours as humans. \nThat also means we'll have to intentionally invest in new skills. No longer is an artist a role for someone else\u2014I think that technology is pushing all of us to become artists.\nWater simulators in Hollywood movies\nTake, for instance, the way Hollywood creates photo-realistic water for movies.\nIn Corridor Crew's video, I Learned How to Fake Water Exactly Like Hollywood, the process involves a sophisticated combination of science, tools, and systems designed to support the VFX artist. \nThere are still technically flaws\u2014they're not simulating water down to the molecular level AND water interacts with other systems like dirt, air, etc.\nAt some point it's diminishing returns to model the complexity of physics and the natural world. Not just because it's complex, but because the whole point is to support the story\u2014the part that the humans came for. \nIn the video, Jordan interviews Chris White, who remarks: At the end of the day we we're still making movies and it's about telling the story.\nThese tools exist to aid and support the artist in telling the story. The need for an artist to guide the process and make decisions remains critical.\n\n    Even if we do reach a point where, on a molecular level we can perfectly recreate water, you would almost still need the artist in order to draw it in such a way that it tells the story that needs to be told.\n\nWhat is an Artist?\nArtists combine technical skills with decision-making skills. They make connections. They tell stories.\nIt is my view that all humans are artists. It's not some gift given to the prodigious, rather it's an innate part of every human being. It's a role we inhabit when the need arises. It is sacred, impactful, and must be re-invested in.\nWe're quickly discouraged from artist pursuits in our current social structures (at least here in Western culture, specifically U.S. culture). A 5-year-old child will be endlessly creative, but a 10-year-old is already feeling the pressure to conform, to leave divergent thinking, to do things that are safer and rewarded more often.\nSo, how do we bring artistry back into our lives as adults?\nHow to become an artist is non-traditional art (like a 9-5 job)\n1. Improve your input\nCreativity often manifests in the fusion of disparate concepts. Consider Lindsey Stirling, who created a new form of artistic expression by combining her two passions: dancing and playing the violin. \nOur work can present opportunities to blend multiple passions or skills or solutions. Sometimes, you have to discover it. Having a bank of new ideas, potential solutions, or even a breadth of knowledge increases that surface area where connections and solutions can be made.\nImprove the quality and variety of your [[Input|inputs]]. It's the first step in cultivating innovative thinking and creativity in your own work.\n2. Hone Your Craft\nContinuously refine your skills: whatever makes your job easier and whatever helps inspire you to move forward. \nIt is vital to improve and to learn\u2014both for your brain health and for your craft. \nI've recently found that this part can be overwhelming. Once you're no longer a beginner and you realize how little you really know, the progress slows and it feels so much harder to learn or improve.\nThe point is to keep going, keep trying. It's not about milestones and measurements, comparison and competition. \nThis is your journey. No effort is truly wasted, because even failure is a teacher. Your craft, whether it's accounting, or teaching, or data entry, or web development, is a pursuit, not a destination.\nBeing on the journey is honing your craft.\n3. Experiment and  practice\nThe continuous process of experimentation, refinement, and failure is where real artistry is born. \nThe experimental mindset allows you to explore new techniques, challenge your boundaries, and zero-in on your unique voice and style.\nPutting in the time, the reps and also shaking things up frequently will help you break through barriers. It's hard, but it's also usually fun\u2014hopefully.\nCyborg\nAs we look to the future with the technology that is rapidly advancing beyond what we can comprehend or keep pace with, we'll want to maintain our claim on artistry.\nTech will continue to push forward, and that can be used to our advantage or our disadvantage.\nThe hardest part is figuring out how to allow technology to push us up the proverbial ladder into strategic, decision-making roles, without letting technology push us off the ladder.\nFor now, I think the most important thing we can do is cultivate our creativity, practice decision-making, continuously experiment, iterate, update, and shake up our inputs.\nWe must all become artists\u2014again.

It smelled like concrete, metal, and chemicals. Our photography teacher was fiddling with something at his desk so the rest of us were getting settled in the new environment with new people.\nJosh was there\u2014one of the only familiar faces to me. We\u2019d been classmates for 8 years. He was a ridiculous, hilarious kid. But today, I was pretty sure he was going to be clobbered into a pulp.\nAlways the class clown, he started engaging some punk 9th grader whose language already made it clear he wasn\u2019t going to be messed with.\nI sat and watched, wondering when my friend was going to get the beat-down.\nMiraculously, as Josh worked away at this punk, he somehow not only \u201cdisarmed\u201d and \u201cde-escalated\u201d the tension, but actually drew out true laughter from Mr. Tough Guy. Josh had turned someone who had presented as an enemy into a friend. I was dumbfounded and amazed.\nJosh had a seemingly magical power to soften difficult situations, elevate energy, create entertainment and enjoyment out of the mundane.\nHe had mastered humor, and I wanted to learn what he instinctually understood.\nSecret Powers of Humor\nHumor has a way with people. Jesters were likely the only people who could tell the truth\u2014\u201dsay it how it is\u201d\u2014to royalty and not lose their lives for such a thing.\nIt\u2019s hard to corroborate this (I don\u2019t have sufficient access to credible sources), but it does, at least, make sense to modern minds that truths\u2014even harsh truths\u2014told in a way that allows us to laugh at ourselves is so much easier to take than a cold, menacing message communicating the same thing.\nMuch of the content of comedians has to do with telling the truth. Comedians look at what\u2019s really happening in the world and they tell that truth. Sometimes it\u2019s looking at things in a different way. Sometimes it\u2019s offensive. Sometimes it\u2019s a unique pairing of two opposites.\nIt all adds up to an experience where we can feel tension and discomfort and then release that with laughter.\nHumor also asks something of us as listeners/viewers. We have to be willing to put ourselves in a vulnerable situation. Even if you\u2019re aren\u2019t literally the butt of a comedian\u2019s joke, it\u2019s likely something their routine touches on will relate to you personally.\nAs we practice suspending our ego and taking a look at ourselves from this \u201coutside\u201d perspective, we can find insights, develop empathy, and even change our minds.\nHumor can cut through the facades. It can unite different groups of people. It can calm fears. It can console. It can help us get through the worst experiences of our lives.\nTurns out, the \u201cfool\u201d is kind of an important role in society.\nDangers and Humor\nNot to make a sweeping statement, but there are a lot of instances where comedy is a coping mechanism for extremely difficult and traumatic circumstances.\nI read \u201cWill,\u201d by Will Smith and Mark Manson earlier this year. It was stunningly honest, introspective, and entertaining. In it, Will Smith reveals the traumatic family life he experienced growing up that brought out this \u201cfunny guy\u201d role for him.\nAs long as everyone was laughing, they weren\u2019t getting hurt.\nI have no idea about the psychology or any other studies done, but I would venture to say that we should give more grace to the class clowns, the goofy ones, the jokesters. There\u2019s always more under the surface than we will know, trauma or not.\nCyborg\nThe use of humor can be applied throughout all of our physical and digital experiences. It\u2019s a tool like any other.\nAs a YouTuber, I have received some less-than-kind comments. I\u2019ve had comments that are overly aggressive and rude. I will say that it\u2019s a minority\u2014I know many other creators that get hammered much more than I ever have; I deserve no pity or sympathy as my experience has been largely positive.\nStill, I\u2019ve found that humor is a great way to de-escalate the heat for many of the comments. I\u2019ve tried responding light-heartedly, offering self-deprecating humor, or validating / poking fun at the same part of the video that is being criticized. This can help people remember that I\u2019m a human, too\u2014and you can feel the difference when they comment again in response.\n\n\nExample comment of a criticism of my video. This one is very tame and not rude, but I was able to add a little bit more value with some humor.\n\nContext of the image above: This comment was not rude, but it is pointing out the poor job I did in recording an interview outside. Lots of people complained about the bird in this series\u2014it was very loud and made it difficult to hear the actual story.\nThat\u2019s not to say some comments should even be given the time of day. Always temper an exploration of tools like this with the wisdom you have within you.\nBe safe. Don\u2019t engage if you can\u2019t do so safely\u2014however \u201csafely\u201d might mean in the situation. Delete / turn off comments. Ignore them. Report them. Humor is just one possible tool.\nI have noticed I\u2019ve taken myself too seriously lately. I\u2019ve defaulted to feeling threatened, diminished, devalued, dismissed. I\u2019ll be exploring where I can insert some humor into my life again.\nOur tech can sometimes trap us in feelings like this. I don\u2019t think that looking at more funny viral videos is the answer to inserting humor into my life. I do think a lot of the value comes from creating my own laughter. Becoming a comedian again in my real-life relationships.\nMaybe it can help you, too?\nTo more laughter!\n Tags: "}, {"title": "Learning Flow", "category": "Newsletters", "href": "/newsletters/learning-flow/", "body": " \u00b6 What's the difference between a skill and a trick?\nSpinning a staff from side to side is already tough. It does take skill to do it without hitting your head or any other part of your body near the path of the staff. But the more I do it, just spinning the staff has felt more like a trick to me.\nMaybe I'm splitting hairs, but this new way of looking at it has started to teach me something unexpected.\nOver my life, I've collected a lot of random tricks.\nMagic tricks, juggling tricks, drawing tricks, computer tricks.\nThese have been a source of immense joy and engagement for me. Lately, though, I've been craving the next level.\nThat point where you can turn a trick into a skill, I now believe, is when you can flow with it.\nBack to staff spinning, I started trying to learn how to spin it in front of me, then turn sharply to face the opposite direction while the staff is still spinning.\n\n    \n    One of my first attempts at walking while spinning the staff\n\nOnce I kind of got the hang of it, I wondered: &quot;Can I walk with it?&quot;\nAs soon as I started taking a few steps, doing an about-face, and walking back to where I started\u2014all while maintaining the spin\u2014I could feel the trick starting to turn into a skill.\nNote: I still think you need skills to perform tricks. Tricks are super cool. But something about this extra step of integrating the trick has unlocked something for me, which is why I'm making a distinction with the vocabulary here.\nIn a lot of ways, this mimics the process of learning that the brain uses: Each trick is a neural pathway emerging. The connections between neurons and other paths increases the speed at which we can access those tricks and eventually gets to the point where we can call upon them with less effort.\nFlow\nThis is that state you get into when you get really focused and are working at your best. Time passes without notice and you are &quot;in the zone.&quot;\nFlow can apply to pretty much any task. \nMy new goal for all of these disparate tricks I've collected over the years is to be able to use them in flow. Meaning both the psychological state of flow, but also in the sense of a connectedness between tricks.\nFor example, being able to do one magic trick is fine, but being able to build an experience for people with magic is that flow state. Maybe that means only two magic tricks, but they're combined in a way that flows, that feels natural to me as the performer.\nTaking it one level further is the ability to change plans in the middle of the performance and make decisions on the spot. Maybe something goes wrong, or maybe the context is asking for something slightly different than when you started. A magician knows how to read their audience, how to react to others' reactions, how to change pace or tie things together.\nThat improvisation factor within flow (maybe because of flow) is where I see true skill underlying the individual tricks.\nPractice Makes Permanent\nFlow and improv sound like they are talent-driven. Something that is hard to access for average people; something that is available only to those with a special gift. \nThis is false.\nI've heard many professional speakers remark that the way they became smooth, articulate, and polished is by practicing. Even improv comedians are practicing, refining, and exploring all the time.\nThe gap between what you do and what they do is just a matter of practice time. (And there's also the risk of widening the perception of that gap with comparison and self-judgment, so be wary.)\nThe point is choosing what skill you want to practice. There are infinite skills and choices, so what do you want to invest your time in?\nCyborg\nFor me, I still want to invest in a breadth of tricks. It's good for the brain to practice things I'm unfamiliar with and especially to try ambidextrous or bilateral skills like juggling.\nI also want to make connections between these tricks\u2014these techniques\u2014so that I can start to pull them into my flow.\nThis is the same thing I do when programming. I've learned so many tricks in web development, and I'm finally getting to the point where the skill is emerging. I can call on the right tricks at the right time to fit into or support a larger system.\nWe can all do this in our own domains and fields.\nStarting, as always, with the basics. But the step that we don't always follow through with is forging the connections to other skills or processes or patterns or goals or outcomes.\nBuilding up this expertise is important because it elevates your impact, broadens the view, and creates new opportunities.\nI wonder if this is the new way of learning in the age of technology and AI?\n Tags: "}, {"title": "Our Journey to Mordor", "category": "Newsletters", "href": "/newsletters/our-journey-to-mordor/", "body": "A reflection on living with MS and finding meaning through the lens of Middle-earth's smallest heroes. \u00b6 I wish none of this had happened, Frodo says solemnly in the dark of Moria.\nSo do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us, Gandalf responds quietly.\nIt's a timeless conversation with infinite application. \nI wish I never had Multiple Sclerosis (MS). I wish the wars and violence in the world had never started. I wish I had never developed the deep psychological scars from my car accident.\nBut it's not for me to decide what happens to me. I can do a lot of things for my health and safety and well-being, but there are no guarantees of success. There is no perfect world or system. There is pain and sorrow yet to be had.\nSo, is Gandalf's message encouraging? Discouraging? Futile?\nAccessibility\nThe design of products or environments can either help or disparage people with disabilities. Accessibility is the attempt to design the things with which people interact in a way that allows people to effectively use the products or environments despite disability.\nThis could mean curb cuts on sidewalks, tactile paving, or ramps that lead into building entrances.\nIn web development, that means making sure that the site is still usable and helpful whether a visitor is sighted or non-sighted, whether they need reduced animations or effects, whether they are using a mouse or a keyboard or a screen reader to navigate.\nIt's one way that we can communicate that people matter.\nTake this scene from The Fellowship of the Ring as an example of accessibility in the world of Middle Earth.\n\n    \n    Hobbits knock at the gate with two windows (one taller and one shorter)\n\nThe hobbits approach a large gate. The gate keeper opens his window and, seeing that whoever knocked on the door is half the size of a typical man, opens another shorter window to be able to speak face to face with the hobbits.\n\n    \n    Gate keeper at the lower window\n\nThe movie makes it feel like the hobbits are so out-of-place in this first environment of &quot;Men.&quot; \nYet the town, in-universe, has apparently had enough experience with &quot;halflings&quot; or perhaps dwarves, that they've built ways to be able to interact with them safely through the gate.\nDisability\nHaving grown up as an able-bodied person and then developing a disability later in life, I've realized there are a lot of ways I've been part of a system that marginalizes less-abled or disabled people.\nDisclaimer: I can't speak for the disabled community as a whole\u2014there are so many disabilities and ways that people talk about, identify, and deal with their specific situation. So this is coming from my view point, but with attempts to capture some of the perspectives of others that I've heard personally.\nThe word &quot;disability&quot; can be a scary one. Some people will identify directly with it: &quot;I'm a disabled person.&quot; Some will accept it, but distance it: &quot;I'm a person with a disability.&quot; Neither is wrong or right, better, or worse. \nThe problem with the word &quot;disability&quot; is that we've attached judgment to it for so long that it carries that same baggage. Instead of being afraid of the word or telling people how they should or shouldn't use it, I would hope that we can be more comfortable with it and its complexities.\nAs I have had to come to grips with my new reality\u2014the one where MS is a part of my life and does affect me\u2014I have had to accept disability. There are limits, there are problems, and to deny that is dishonest and psychologically harmful.\nIf we look back at The Lord of the Rings, there are themes of disability at play throughout the trilogy. The hobbits each express frustration and stress at the disabilities that come from their physical limitations in a Man-sized world. \nMerry states in the last movie: I know there is not much point now in hoping. If I were a knight of Rohan capable of great deeds\u2026but I'm not. I'm a Hobbit. And I know I can't save Middle-Earth. I just want to help my friends.\n\n    \n    Merry's despair\n\nThey also experience prejudice, which in a way disables them as well. Regarding Merry's plea to fight alongside the riders of Rohan, Eomer says to his sister, I do not doubt his heart, only the reach of his arm.\nWhat to do when the odds continue to stack against you?\nAcceptance\nWhat strikes me about watching the series with the themes of disability in mind is that each hobbit not only expresses frustration or despair at some point, but they all eventually accept it, which allows them to progress.\nThat is something I find to be common in the disabled community.\nThere is no point in denying or pretending that our disabilities don't affect us. Messaging that ignores the reality of disability or even that tries to euphemize disability is often more harmful.\nThere's a fine line that we can waffle around when we try to empower others or ourselves in these complex circumstances.\nWhat I have found to be helpful is to seek for honesty in my reality\u2014a radical acceptance of how I am and what my life is like. Without it, I'm too trapped in the riptide of expectations getting dashed to pieces over and over again.\nBut I'm realizing there is also a need to have some hopes. Some expectations. If I ever want to keep going, there has to be some kind of hope.\nI found Aragorn's character to be a little annoying in my most recent viewing of The Lord of the Rings, because he is so often Mr. &quot;There is always hope.&quot; Even when the entire field of view of the camera is filled with orcs and beasts. Even when every advantage or potential alliance is fractured, Aragorn is the guy telling everyone that there is still hope.\nThen, towards the end he has a tiny, despairing moment where it's implied he no longer believes his own platitudes. He falls to his knees and watches with watering eyes as yet another horde of Sauron's allies glide closer in pirate ships.\n\n    \n    Aragorn's despair\n\nAragorn's journey to this point has been under the surface of this forced positivity and it seems like this breaking point is where Aragorn moves to an acceptance of reality.\nHe ends up with a deus ex machina to win the battle at Gondor then does something unthinkable. \nJust when an impossible battle was won, after impossible circumstances and impossible drain on human endurance or strength, Aragorn throws himself and his lingering armies of Men into one more futile situation.\nLed to the Black Gate of Mordor, the Men and remaining members of the Fellowship stare down a massive army of orcs that surrounds and encircles their entire force.\n\n    \n    Army of Mordor at the Black Gate\n\nGandalf's words come back to me here: All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.\nThere has already been so much loss, grief, pain, sorrow. Why are they doing this? \nThis conflict is different than all of the others in the entire series. This is an offensive move. This is where the acceptance gets real and the hope also gets real.\nThe only reason to throw their lives away is the hope that it will be just enough for Frodo to destroy the Ring and truly end the real conflict.\nHope in the face of futility, fueled by radical acceptance.\nCyborg\nMany of us face impossible circumstances where hope feels futile, where things are so hard that giving up feels like the only option left.\nIt is in those moments that we have to make decisions\u2014perhaps decisions that cannot be made until the very end, forced by the circumstance.\nAcceptance is a personal thing. You can't do it for someone else. Acceptance is a thing that feels like futility wins or that you are giving up. More often, it is that acceptance that actually moves us forward and reveals new paths.\nAwareness is Aragorn's final lesson. That is something that we can do for others: see them, see their realities. Then do what you can to protect or amplify their humanity.

Most Apple products use this style in icons and other features, but many other apps and products use it, too. It was especially popular in the early 2000s, before we trended towards more minimalist and &quot;flat&quot; designs.\nThe style is all about borrowing the visuals from real-life objects and &quot;remaking&quot; them in a digital world. Think folder icons that look like real-world folders. The trash/recycling bin (especially on a MacOS) looks like one that might be around your home\u2014they even show crumpled up objects in it when you've deleted something.\n\n    \n\nThe look sometimes seems outdated now, but part of the reason it was used in the first place is to help people make the switch from their real-world office work to the computer. Borrowing the look of real objects and using these metaphors, like folders and a trash bin, helped people connect the dots of what was happening in these new-fangled machines.\nThis isn't just a primitive design trend, its concept is based on a solid fundamental (consider one of Dieter Rams's principles for good design &quot;Good design makes a product understandable&quot;). We can also take real-world or physical metaphors into our digital spaces to improve our habits and our memory.\nDigital Habits\nI was a MacOS-hater for most of my life until I discovered python and shell scripting. Of course you can use python on Windows, but a Unix-based OS is just so much easier to work with in my experience.\nThat aside, there's still a gripe I have with MacOS: the messiness! \nIcons on the desktop can sometimes overlap each other when automatically placed. Program windows end up piled on top of others, and it makes everything feel cluttered.\n\n    \n\nIt's these little details about our digital spaces that can impact our habits in a big way.\nI don't love taking a full minute every single day rearranging all of my windows back to the way I want, but it's massively important to me. \nMy code needs to be on the right and the browser on the left so I can easily see how my code affects the page I'm working on. That's just the monitor. \nOn my laptop, I need Slack open, my calendar, and another browser for researching errors so that I don't have to dig around for another tab or browser instance on my monitor.\nThe Windows OS makes it easy to simply drag your windows to the side or top of the screen and it will fill the space or make split-screen a breeze. (You can also use a keyboard shortcut: Windows Key + An Arrow Key to move or size your window how you want).\nLuckily, an independent developer took it upon themselves to make Mac window organization so much easier. Not a sponsored link, but I have been using the free version and it's solved so many frustrations for me: Rectangle App\nMess is unavoidable, especially for creative work. However, being able to clean up that mess or at least get a little bit of a handle on it has done wonders for my motivation day-to-day. Just like a clean physical desk or office, a tidy collection of screens and windows feels less stressful.\nHere are a few more of my digital habits that have helped me stay focused, improved my productivity, and reduced overwhelm:\n1. Close browser tabs as soon as possible\u2014I use Obsidian (my [[PKM]] software) to keep track of websites that I don't want to lose. This lets me add keywords and notes so that I can find it again and remember why it mattered.\nThe real-world metaphor here is like what my mom always told me: &quot;When you're done with it, put it away!&quot;\n2. Shut down (completely power-off) my computer at the end of the workday. This forces a fresh start every day. I don't allow my browser to &quot;start where I left off&quot; and auto-open 20 tabs. I only allow the computer to open the apps that I use every day (VS Code, Slack, Chrome, etc.). \nThis is like taking a few minutes at the end of the day to clean up your desk, so that you come to work tomorrow fresh and organized.\n3 Use desktops for specific tasks. On both Windows and Mac, you can set up a screen layout, then switch to another layout. This is useful for two, maybe three, distinct workflows that need to be running that day. I try to stick to one, but if I need to test something, for example, I'll throw a new browser window onto the other desktop with the webpage already open so when it's time to test, I switch desktops, refresh and watch for the new changes.\nIt's reminiscent of work that has to be done in two or more different spaces. Maybe a scientist who goes to one countertop to look in a microscope, then moves over to another to make notes, then moves to another to store the samples.\nMemory\nHumans are designed with spatial memory\u2014we can remember things pretty well when they're associated with a particular place. So, yeah, your kid isn't necessarily lying when you ask how they can possibly find anything in their messy bedroom and they respond:\n&quot;I know exactly where everything is...&quot;\nJust like the tricks that memory athletes (yes, that's a thing) use to remember lists of random words or memorize the order of a shuffled deck of cards, we can also use our digital space in a way that helps our memory.\nThe method I think is most applicable here is the Loci Method, also known as a Memory Palace. This is where you map out the things you need to memorize to a physical space in your mind. Usually based on actual spaces you are familiar with, you take sets of two or three bits of information and connect it to a spot in your space. One of the best ways to further cement this is with imaginative stories.\nFor example, if I wanted to remember this first set of cards: jack of spades, 4 of hearts, 4 of diamonds, I might imagine my parents' garden. I'm digging in the dirt (&quot;Jack&quot; has a funny and special connection to me), and as I bury four hearts, I unearth four diamonds.\nWhatever the story is, it will sound absurd to you, but for me, designing that story makes it much easier for me to remember some random sequence of cards. (Check out Nelson Dellis's YouTube channel for more information on this method!)\nWe can do something similar in our PKM/note-taking systems. The goal is to use the location of information to help trigger the memory of the information.\nWe know, referring back to the research for last week's CYBORG_, that we are inclined to remember the source of information over the information itself:\n\n&quot;Moreover, when people search for information on the Internet while working on the Internet, they are more likely to use the Internet rather than their brain the next time they encounter that issue, and they retain pertinent information in an interesting way: they remember the Internet address where the pertinent information is stored (e.g., domain name, database, etc.). People who have searched the Internet for a solution to a problem, for example, will remember the website where they found the solution more vividly when they encounter the problem again, even if they have forgotten the precise essence of the problem for which they were searching.&quot;\nGoogle Effects on Memory\n\nWe can attach memories and experiences to these digital spaces so that we can more readily find the things we want to reference later. We can also design our digital spaces to support our actual memory of the details.\nInstead of trying to completely copy or quote a resource and call it a note, when we add a little bit of effort to actually respond to the information, it becomes easier to remember the information.\nIn my experience, this shifts my location memory to Obsidian, rather than the website, so at first, it doesn't seem like much has changed.\nThe difference is that because I spent time with my notes\u2014adding my thoughts to the quotes I've pulled out, connecting different notes to each other\u2014I've actually started to distill the information.\nBecoming more familiar with the information I've deemed important enough to take notes on helps me not just remember that the info is in Obsidian, but it also reminds me of the conclusions I've come to or the evidence I've captured, similar to the memory palace.\nThis is all anecdotal at this point, purely my experience, but I feel like this is a way to strike a balance between over-investing in the Internet as my memory and over-investing in memorizing all the things that are inconsequential to my daily life (since there is just too much information out there, we have to prioritize what to remember anyway).\nCYBORG\nOur physical spaces impact our mood, our productivity, our work, our play. We often use the movement between those physical spaces to cause a change in our readiness for various tasks. \nFor example, I have a home office where I do all of my work. When I leave that room, I'm now changing modes for a different task\u2014perhaps to relax or to exercise or to eat.\nWhen we compartmentalize the tasks to the location, it becomes extremely easy to &quot;get into the mood&quot; to do your work or accomplish a specific goal.\nThis principle applies to the digital realm. We can use window and desktop management shortcuts and we can use certain apps to design little &quot;rooms&quot; for our workflows.\nWe can also use locations (digital and physical) to trigger memories of information.\nUltimately, it is all by design. \nWe can either let others determine the design or we can get intentional with how we use our digital spaces.\n Tags: "}, {"title": "Rigidity is death...", "category": "Newsletters", "href": "/newsletters/rigidity-is-death/", "body": "Why rigid structures often fail, and how modular, adaptable approaches can enhance both technology and human interactions. \u00b6 ...flexibility is life. So says my Sensei.\nWhen we build systems and tools to help us solve problems, there is a pitfall, especially when you first start.\nThe first version of the CMS I created at work was exceptionally rigid. There was a field for every bit of text, and you weren\u2019t supposed to be able to break the template design because each field was mapped exactly.\nThe pitfall came when people discovered they could start hacking\u2014inserting their own (less ideal) HTML code in certain fields. Soon we had a template that broke both the design guidelines and my own system.\nThe need for flexibility broke the system by inserting bugs, inconsistency, and the maverick attitude.\nThe problem wasn\u2019t really how it was used, but how it was built, and the behavior was in response to a poorly designed system.\nThe next version of the CMS offered greater flexibility\u2014being able to create pages using small building blocks and allowing the creator to do whatever they wanted with those pieces.\nSystems\nEvery system has its vulnerabilities, but the more rigid the system, the more likely it will break under use.\nThis applies in more than just technology. I recently had an eye-opening discussion with a group of academics and theologians about the theories behind Christian religious groups. The more rigid or maximalist a group\u2019s theology/ideology, the more fragile it becomes.\nWhether because the ideology becomes too exclusive even to its members or causes objective harm to people, the rigid system becomes a \u201cstumbling block\u201d and loses its value and ability to propel people forward in progress.\nFlexibility is life\u2014it\u2019s the evidence of it, but it also supports that life.\nThe trick is where to build rigidity and where to build flexibility.\nModularity\nThere\u2019s a design pattern from the programming world that can help us solve this puzzle.\nIf we think of our systems or whatever we\u2019re building as a stack of LEGO bricks, we can build in \u201cmodules\u201d or parts that can moved around in the stack or even used in other stacks.\nThe design pattern is this: There is only data and behavior, and a function should only handle one of those things.\nA function just means one of those \u201cbricks\u201d or one part in your system&nbsp;/ process. That part either holds information in some way or it performs some kind of action. By keeping it simple and specialized, you can move that part and reuse that part in many scenarios.\nAn Example\nProject management can seem pretty straightforward until you have to accept requests from people who don\u2019t understand what you do.\nI\u2019ve used or set up several request form systems now but I still find that people submit things to me when they should have submitted them to someone else, or they misunderstand how I can help them.\nThe more rigid and specific the request form, the worse submissions I\u2019ve received.\nIf, instead, I build in a little flexibility\u2014allowing them to describe what they need and then categorizing it for them\u2014I get better flow within my system.\nModularity helps me with that flexibility, because I can use one &quot;description&quot; field to hold data. The data means something in one context (e.g. a bug report), but it means another thing in a second context (e.g. UX research).\nThe rigidity simply becomes the insistence of using the form to send me requests, but the flexibility allows that intake to work without frustrating the people using the form and without frustrating me.\nA Word from Martha Stewart\nI happened to be watching an email marketing conference keynote (Guru, 2023), and whaddaya know? Martha Stewart drops the gem: \u201cRigidity in business is bad.\u201d\nThere you have it.\nHumanity and flexibility are inseparable.

No, I don't consider it &quot;light&quot; reading, nor am I reading it for hours on end, but I love finding new words and exploring their meaning. Especially the etymology\u2014the study of word origins and evolution over time. \nI've recently run into a problem with my love of words: the &quot;appeal to dictionary fallacy.&quot;\nIn my mind, dictionaries were supposed to be the law-givers: This word means this concept. You may or may not use (insert word here) like this...\nThe fallacy in appealing to the dictionary is a misunderstanding of what a dictionary actually is. It describes how words are used to mean certain things. It does not prescribe what they mean.\nThat\u2019s why dictionaries are updated, why they change\u2014because language changes. The way we collectively use words changes.\nIt turns out, definitions are much more difficult to arrive at than it sometimes seems. The act of naming something is, at its core, a practice of defining something.\nToday\u2019s newsletter will focus on PKM and creativity regarding this naming problem. Next week, we\u2019ll take a look at how naming has implications in our technology that range from complicating to dangerous.\nPKM Problems with Names\nI\u2019ve noticed that when I start a new note in Obsidian, I\u2019m immediately limited by the very first action: giving the note a name.\n\u201cUntitled\u201d is the default, and it not only bothers me to leave it like that, the keyboard cursor is also automatically focused to the title of the note\u2014just like any other note taking app.\nIt seems like the right flow: Title it, add content, done.\nThe problem is that in a note-taking or creative context, this approach is exceptionally limiting. I have not yet processed my thoughts. Sure, maybe there\u2019s a theme, or something generically cohesive about what I\u2019m trying to write, but starting with that puts a cap in mind about where I am going\u2014or where I might go.\nIt's all psychological, because I can always change the title, but something about defining it upfront makes it feel final; determined.\nWhen I start a note, I want to be able to put down my thoughts: uncensored, unedited, and unorganized. It's a collection and discovery phase of thinking. This is where things are added.\nCreating a title is part of an evaluation phase. That's where things are subtracted or divided. I don't want to start with subtraction or division\u2014remember your math classes? Dividing with zero is really bad ;)\nPersonal SEO\nNaming a note or a file is more than just a creativity barrier. It provides an organizational issue in an environment that is no longer scoped to folders. Now that I have many hundreds of notes and references, the titles become a barrier to finding the content that I want.\nI have to make sure the titles are unique. I also try to insert keywords so that I know how the note applies to certain concepts at a glance.\nIt\u2019s an SEO (search engine optimization) problem. We\u2019re now in analytical mode, trying to make sure we don\u2019t lose this note in the mess of hundreds of others.\n\n    \n    Example of how my titles have started to be repetitive and unhelpful when searching by name. Searching for \"django test\" pulls up many potential notes, some are too generic to know if they are the right resource.\n\nWe have a few tools to help us with this optimization: content, links to other notes, and keywords.\nObsidian\u2019s graph view allows you to visually see connections between notes through links, similar to websites. This is another search method that supplements search results involving titles.\n\n    \n    Opening the local graph of a note reveals other notes that are linked to it. This is a search result that only shows titles, but the connections are from the content.\n\nMost apps come equipped with decent search tools that don\u2019t just look at the title of files. That means you can use techniques like adding keywords to your note content that you\u2019re pretty sure you\u2019ll use in the search bar to find the note again.\nThe real trick here is to be very intentional about getting the content on the page first, and having a review phase afterwards as part of the note-taking system\u2019s maintenance.\nAlternative Options\nAfter-the-fact Update\nTo break the pattern of starting with a name, you can always just make it part of the process to ignore the title (let it be \u201cUntitled 27\u201d) and then just start typing your note. You can always change it when you\u2019re done.\nIf you\u2019re really bad at remembering to change the title, set a reminder every month or so to just do a search for \u201cUntitled\u201d and go through each file to rename it.\nDaily Notes\nIf your PKM software has a daily note function, you can use it to stay creative and avoid naming until you\u2019re ready. When I open Obsidian for the first time that day, it automatically opens a new note, titled as the current date.\nThe trick here is to use these daily notes\u00a0not\u00a0as a journal or a record, but as a scratch pad. I dump my thoughts, my notes, my references.\nClean up the content and move it into a real note\u2014this way you stay in creative mode when creating the content, but move into editing/analytical mode when cleaning out the queue of daily notes. The goal here is to delete each daily note. Always be on the look-out for how to move content out of the daily note and into your real notes.\nThis has worked well for me in my personal Obsidian system, but it does mean that I have a separate processing day, usually a Sunday, where I look through the daily notes and rename or move them out. It can add a bit of extra work when I forget and have many daily notes piled up.\nDifferent Input System\nI really want my Obsidian vault to be a useful, creative, productive tool. That means sometimes I prefer to collect random thoughts and scratches of ideas in an entirely different system. Physical notebooks were my go-to until I got a reMarkable 2 tablet. Now that\u2019s my companion for capturing things that don\u2019t make sense or aren\u2019t fully developed yet.\nIt does add a few extra steps, similar to the Daily Notes flow. I have to review it at some point, use their handy handwriting-to-text conversion (which is pretty good, even with my handwriting), and copy the text into new notes.\nHowever, slowing down like this helps me work through my ideas and make it ready for future use. It also allows me to delete things when I can see they really aren\u2019t useful to me.\nSplitting up the creative process of brainstorming and building up ideas from the analytical process of evaluating the ideas has monumentally changed my ability to write better, create more interesting content, and even build better code.

If you want to store some information in a database, you need a name for the information. \nSome &quot;names&quot; might be randomly generated IDs, like kuf3h4kuhbwe78gyejdhg but if you want to be able to perform some kind of logic, you\u2019ll still have to put that in a human-readable form like a variable (which will have a name).\nYou can think of it like form field labels. When you fill out a form, you have a label that tells you what kind of information is expected.\n\n    \n    Form with a field for \"First Name\" and \"Email Address\"\n\nThe label is likely the name that the database ends up using to store your information.\nThis gets really tricky in medical scenarios, demographics, and other personal identification information.\nPerhaps you\u2019re a programmer tasked with setting up a check-in form for a doctor\u2019s office. There are the\u00a0seemingly\u00a0easy fields: Name, phone number, birthdate. Then you need the sex of the person.\nShould you provide two fields for \u201csex\u201d and \u201cgender\u201d so that the doctor can be aware and respectful of a person\u2019s identity? Do you only include \u201csex\u201d because you\u2019re not even thinking about queer identities? Should you provide an option for \u201cintersex\u201d in addition to \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale\u201d to account for the natural occurrences of indeterminate or \u201cdifficult to categorize\u201d anatomy?\nNaming things is exceptionally difficult, because ambiguity pervades all aspects of our lives, much as we try to make things binary or, at least, clearly defined.\nThe Fuzzy\nThe other reason naming things is so hard has to do with our cognition (how we think). Prototype Theory, developed by Eleanor Rosch, challenges the classical take on categorizing things, and helps explain why we run into trouble with our names.\nAccording to the theory, our brains group things together based on their relationship or closeness to the prototypical thing\u2014a &quot;family resemblance&quot; if you will. The prototype of something is built by our individual experiences with objects or concepts.\nAs a percussionist, I know what a marimba is, but many people assume that what I'm playing is a xylophone\u2014because they look very similar and xylophone is a word more commonly known. However, due to my experience I can easily distinguish a xylophone from a marimba\u2014they hold two different &quot;prototypes&quot; for me, while non-percussionists tend to have one single prototype for the &quot;wooden instrument that looks like it has a piano-key layout.&quot;\nThe Classical Theory of categorization is the idea that we can clearly define things by \u201cnecessary and sufficient features.\u201d We create boxes, put things in boxes, and they\u2019re supposed to stay in those boxes, nice and organized.\nThis is where the \u201cappeal to dictionary\u201d fallacy I mentioned last week tends to get me.\n\u201cThis is common for most words that we see used frequently. If we have a backlog of experiences hearing words being used in reference to certain concepts or items or entities, we just intuitively\u2026generate a concept of what that thing is,\u201d says Dr. Dan McClellan on his podcast, Data Over Dogma.\n\u201cA lot of people\u2026what they\u2019re going to do is just retreat into their mind and try to imagine the imagery; the conceptual field that is evoked from that word; and then try to describe or define that.\u201d\n\u201cThe problem is that\u2019s entirely relative. It\u2019s going to be different for every person because we all have different experiences.\u201d\nDefinitions are always incomplete\u2014they can get close, but they\u2019ll always leave out something or include something that doesn\u2019t always fit. To \u201cdefine\u201d something is an attempt to find the edge of where something stops being itself\u2014but in the act of drawing boundaries around concepts or items or even people, there are always going to be things that don\u2019t quite fit, or that challenge those boundaries.\nConsider a chair for a moment.\nWhat comes to mind? How do you know what a chair is? Maybe it looks something like this:\n\n    \n    AI-generated image of a simple kitchen chair.\n\nClassical Theory would prompt us to define a chair like this: it has four legs, a backrest, and is something we sit on.\nWhat about this design? \n\n    \n    AI-generated image of a chair with no legs, rather a single base to support it.\n\nNow we only have a backrest and it\u2019s something that looks like we can sit on.\nThese two chair pictures were easily generated with AI. The first image was a simple prompt to generate a photo of a chair. The second one needed prompting to show a \u201cunique chair\u201d like one you might see in the MoMa (and the AI struggled to get me anything more unique in design than the one above).\nNow, let's start playing with the boundaries even more:\n\n    \n    S-Chair: a single, continuous line curves through space to create a chair with an intriguing shape\u2014almost like an \"S\" from the side view.\n\nThis is the &quot;S-Chair&quot; from Tom Vaughan (credit: https://www.objectstudio.co.uk/oldgallery#/vii/). Does this challenge your definition of a chair?\nLet's push it even farther with, &quot;Knot,&quot; from the same studio:\n\n    \n    Inspired by the shape of the mobius strip, this piece has multiple interweaving ribbons of wood twisting around itself.\n\nIs it a chair? (I truly am not sure, though it appears to be able to function as a chair if I were so bold as to sit on it).\nWe just went through the Prototype Theory. We started with a prototypical chair, probably similar to one you might think of when hearing the word, \u201cchair.\u201d\nThen we start playing with the boundaries\u2014removing the \u201cleg\u201d requirement, changing the shape. Ultimately, a chair isn\u2019t its legs or its backrest or even the seat. Artists and designers can push the boundaries of our chair-conceptualization and it makes us question the object. Is it a chair? Is it art? Is it both? Is it neither?\nHow do you set up a database to properly categorize something like Knot? How do you reconcile one person's conceptualization of a chair with another person's entirely different conceptualization?\nThe Collision\nThe fuzziness of our named thing can be frustrating and even dangerous. What we think is clear communication might be wildly mistaken by someone else who is bringing a different set of experiences to the table ;)\nMisunderstandings in user interfaces have caused massive catastrophes (like the Hawaiian Missile Alert in 2018). \nSimple names can create collisions when URLs, variables, or objects in code have the same name. It\u2019s like having two houses with the same address\u2014nothing will work right.\nMy own name causes massive problems with background checks, because my name is too common in my generation.\nNames in systems are supposed to be unique, clear, and well-defined. But in practice, that\u2019s not so easy\u2014especially when we get into flexible, but ambiguous systems.\nEven the exploration of Prototype Theory can make my head spin a little bit. Maybe nothing means anything at all\u2026? Is it even possible to communicate well? Is what I know just an illusion that unravels under scrutiny?\nCyborg\nNaming is exceptionally complex, even though it feels easy.\nAsk a child to tell you the name of a new toy or stuffed animal. They\u2019ll probably use some feature to define it: \u201cSpot,\u201d \u201cPinky,\u201d \u201cPrincess,\u201d \u201cLaser-eyes.\u201d\nIt is exceptionally easy to lean on a feature as a way to put a line around something, but life is more complex than just describing pieces that we perceive.\nObjects, concepts, and people aren\u2019t so easily categorized. And that\u2019s simultaneously freeing and frustrating.\nWe will continue to play with our boundaries as people with different experiences, identities, and ideas look at the \u201cdefinitions\u201d others have made.\nWe employ our greatest creativity and problem-solving when we engage with those fuzzy boundaries. Whether that\u2019s to name some piece of code or challenge oppressive systems by creating more space for more people.\nTo name something is to take on a responsibility: to allow enough flexibility to not break the system, but have enough structure that the system can stand.

I hadn't touched an Xbox controller in almost two years, but it had been a favorite past-time before the mission.\nNow that I was adjusting to &quot;civilian&quot; life, I wanted to try the new, enticing game: Assassin's Creed: Black Flag. This was going to be an amazing game, I just knew it. It was set in the Caribbean and I could even play it in Spanish\u2014the assignment of my mission had been to serve that particular demographic.\nI quickly realized this game was actually painful for me. There was an interaction where my character could pickpocket the AI characters on the islands I visited. I was so disgusted and sad. It was easy to project myself into that character I was controlling, and everyone else in the game may as well have been any one of the amazing people I met on my mission. I couldn't do that to them.\nPutting Humanity Back In\nIn the years since, I've watched how I've reintegrated into the immersive digital worlds. My mission was a reset. I hadn't been allowed to use much technology\u2014I was allowed to email my family once a week, and we had an LG Shadow for our phone, complete with a physical keyboard under the tiny screen.\nWhile I'm generally a technology optimist, I've noticed some disturbing behaviors in myself. Like how my initial revulsion to the violence and anti-social behavior of the games I play has faded into desensitization. Or how I can have explosive reactions to minor issues at work (I've learned I can type pretty furiously, poor keyboard...).\nEmotions and I have had a tenuous relationship for the majority of my life. As a queer kid, I had to hide a lot. I didn't like my emotions\u2014they made me vulnerable, and vulnerability could mean a threat to physical safety, to belonging, to any number of bad outcomes. In middle school, I made it a secret goal to desensitize myself from gore, violence, anger, because I thought that would make me both stronger and more intimidating.\nIf I had no emotions to exploit, if I could be unshaken and unfazed by violence, then I could survive violence directed at me, or maybe even discourage violence. So, I turned to video games and horror movies to help me build my walls. \nAll of the repression turned into depression, and I had to feel things again. \nPain is a great teacher, but I still needed help to reconnect with my emotions. My attempts to desensitize myself from all emotion through my video games, my scary movies, my obsession with work, had failed to help me, and instead continued to hurt me.\nMy mission was a weird break in the middle of all of this. It was an experience that taught me that there are real people out there. They're not just non-player characters (NPCs) in one of my games that I can manipulate by saying the right things. It was a reality check that put humanity back into my life.\nI've been chasing the balance of technology and humanity ever since.\nBefore we move on, note that I am not a psychologist and the is not professional advice. If you feel like this resonates and need more information, or if you are distressed or need support, I'd encourage you to find a professional therapist.\nEmotional Intelligence\nWorking with a therapist for several years now, I'm finally starting to develop the emotional intelligence that I've been missing.\nThe hardest part for me is to stay with my feelings and actually feel them. I don't like them\u2014especially the &quot;primary emotions,&quot; so I still try to move past them. Anger is my favorite secondary emotion, because it makes me feel stronger; more intimidating to my problems. In reality, it just hurts me and everyone around me.\n\n\n&quot;Primary emotions are the first emotions that you feel for any given event. Secondary emotions are feelings you experience after primary emotion. Secondary emotions usually are more intense emotions that push people away or protect yourself in some way. While primary emotions and usually more uncomfortable by nature and require some vulnerability to experience.&quot;\n\n\n\n\u2014Tyler Rich LMFT, Richer Life Counseling\n\n\nIf emotional intelligence is being able to notice, feel, and express our emotions (appropriately), then I'm still vastly under-developed. However, as I've looked over my choices from the past decades, I'm realizing that it is the most important skill I can work on.\nA digital world presses on our emotions in ways that a physical world does not seem to do as aggressively. Anonymity has super-charged anger in online comments or conversations. Isolation and separation are common features of the virtual experience.\nI don't think it has to be that way. I don't think it is inherently creating these negative experiences. \nI do think that it is more of a revelation of our society's general lack of emotional intelligence, than a suppression of it.\nArtificial Intelligence\nBy design, chatbots using generative AI present us with a difficult problem: remembering it's not a being. We interact with it like we might a colleague over Slack. We ask it questions, we make requests. To the unsuspecting human, it is more and more simple to draw the conclusion that AI is another human-like entity.\nIt's not, though. It's a prediction. It's a complex system of calculations and probabilities that seeks to provide the most likely expected response to a prompt.\nIf we don't have a base of emotional intelligence, we become vulnerable to exploitation and deception. AI doesn't get tired of us, it's always available and it always responds. Even if biases are controlled for and safety measures are taken in the development of the chatbot, we are still vulnerable if our emotional intelligence is low.\nIt has been too easy for me to forget humanity and treat people like objects when I was inundated with games in place of emotions.\nGeneral AI poses that same threat to us and younger generations of people if we don't make an effort to put in the emotional work.\nIf we are going to survive artificial intelligence, it will only happen with emotional intelligence at our side.

It was cathartic in some ways, almost as if I could deal with my demons by watching the scary movies, indulging in massive sugar highs, and taking off my personal &quot;mask&quot; by donning actual masks.\nIn a lot of ways, this Halloween will be similar for me here in the U.S. as we prepare for the explosive reaction after the presidential election. There are a few horror movies that I have found particularly instructive as we approach November.\nThe terror that has accompanied this particular election makes the celebratory terror of Halloween truly seem like child's play. \nWhile I will be talking about U.S. politics, I hope that this brief examination will still be helpful no matter where you are in the world. This is also not just about politics, it's about humanity.\nLens\nIn the world of photography and cinematography, the term &quot;shallow depth of field&quot; refers to the photographs or scenes where the subject is clear, but everything else is blurry. It makes you feel very focused on something, and adds so much distance between the things in frame.\nThe Watchers, a horror film about a few people trapped in a forest by mythological beings that want to watch them in a bunker with a massive mirrored window (or kill them if they stay out of the bunker after nightfall), puts this shallow depth of field to good use.\n\n    \n    Example of shallow depth of field, where Mina (Dakota Fanning) is clearly visible, but each person behind her is blurrier and more obscured the farther they are from the focal point.\n\nThe film starts with obscurity. Only one person is ever shown in focus outside of the forest. The main character, Mina, holds that focus while every other person she interacts with is blurred out by this camera technique or carefully crafted shadows and angles.\nAfter the transformative experience in the forest, people and their faces are shown clearly.\nThis is symbolic of how we can sometimes get trapped in ourselves\u2014and, perhaps, how we can fail to see the humanity in others.\nIn terms of politics and this election, I think many are stuck in the blurring, unsettling, distancing effects of dehumanization. One candidate in the U.S. election has emboldened outrage, racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and xenophobia, to the point that there is almost no one he has not derided, denigrated, and disgraced in some way.\nHe has narrowed the focal point so that you cannot see clearly the humanity of other people, opting instead to make the world seem distant and scary. Full of demons and shadows that only he will somehow save you from.\nThis election, like no other, is a test of humanity. \nCan we broaden our view to include other people, seeing them as people? Or do we choose to squint and see only ourselves as human, forgetting democracy, forgetting the disastrous consequences that will follow?\nUltimately, I think The Watchers is a beautiful exploration of how the only difference between humanity and monstrosity is what you choose to see.\nVoice\nSpeak No Evil (2024) gives us another key to surviving the election.\nWe follow the Dalton family as they meet another family on vacation: Paddy, Ciara, and a young boy named Ant. After the vacation, the Daltons get an invitation from the other family to come stay at their place in the country. They accept, and soon spiral into nightmarish discomfort, shock, and torture.\nThere is a point where they ask Paddy, &quot;Why are you doing this?!&quot;\n&quot;Because you let us,&quot; he replied truthfully.\nIn a masterful expos\u00e9 of manipulation, it reveals the vulnerability we all have in our human social systems. At so many points throughout the movie, Paddy pushes the comfort level of the Dalton family. It started with something as simple as offering to take the Dalton's daughter on a quick moped ride when the two families first met on vacation.\nThere's nothing inherently wrong, but the parents were clearly not thrilled about the idea of a random man taking their daughter on a ride in another country. Paddy continues to poke at the boundaries of what they'll submit to, until he's got them trapped.\nReal abusers use these techniques. Taking advantage of people who don't want to embarrass or &quot;cause a scene&quot; by saying, &quot;No.&quot;\nIt may start with things that seem innocuous, but the more you give, the more they take. \nIn terms of the American election, we've seen how an individual has broken down the tolerance for unacceptable behavior. Maybe it started as seemingly a silly character flaw\u2014don't we all have those? Then it's more than just an old man doing old man things\u2014it's using language that vilifies people that already make you uncomfortable. Then it's encouraging a divide: you can't just be in the middle, that's where the push-overs are; you've got to stand up and fight or they'll come after you.\n&quot;No,&quot; is a word that is taught to be scary. Salesmen try to get you to say &quot;yes&quot; just once, because (as the myth goes, anyway) then you're more likely to say &quot;yes&quot; to the final sale at the end of their manipulative talking points. \nIf you're a woman, you've been shamed away from saying, &quot;No.&quot; You can't just say no to a man because you feel weird. You have to give him a chance. You can't be so picky. You have to protect his fragile ego.\nChris Voss, ex-FBI hostage negotiator, tells us that the word no is a beautiful word. It's about freedom. It allows you to set boundaries, to make corrections, to feel comfortable, to feel in control. It's ok to say, &quot;No,&quot; when something is off. When everyone around you is saying &quot;yes,&quot; because they feel like they have to, saying &quot;no,&quot; immediately releases the tension and emboldens people to stand up for themselves.\nWe can say, &quot;No!&quot; when a politician has gone too far. We can say, &quot;No!&quot; when humanity has been challenged or erased. \nWe are agents, as are all of the other people we encounter. Let's not accept the race to the bottom. Trust your gut, then work on the courage to act accordingly. \nThis is the message for me, myself. I have been far too afraid to say, &quot;No!&quot; for far too long\u2014and I've paid the price for it many times.\nThe descent into madness does not take long, nor much effort, when we silence ourselves. But there's another component that we get from our final horror movie.\nListen\nCommunication is vital\u2014but for communication to happen, it can't just be about our voice.\nThe monsters in the world set by A Quiet Place and A Quiet Place II are predators whose primary sense is hearing. Any sound outside of the general background hum will attract them. \nThe protagonist family in these movies have to find creative ways to reduce noise and continue to communicate with each other.\nAside from the trauma and destruction, the monsters have done something horrendously damaging to the remaining human survivors: removed typical means of communication.\nWithout the ability to communicate with each other, we are fractured. Socially, we can only thrive with communication, but even mentally and emotionally it is a deep human need to be connected and understood.\nThe people in this world suffer the madness of being forcibly enveloped in silence, watching neighbors, friends, and family die. Some betray the safety of others due to this deep emotional wounded-ness. Some try to take advantage. Some sacrifice themselves.\nWe are better together.\nWe need each other\u2014in all of the diversity of thought and experience.\nIt's painful sometimes. It's confusing. It's troublesome. It's enlightening. It's empowering. It's humanity.\nPolarization does not lead to peace or cooperation (key components of rational thought). \nSharon McMahon mentioned that politics and government thrive on a &quot;competition of ideas.&quot; It's not about demonizing or cancelling or stereotyping. It's about the freedom to work on complex problems and find what works better than before.\nIf we lose our humanity in the process, it doesn't matter who wins.\nListening is easily forgotten. Our technology can be used to enhance our ability to listen, but not by default\u2014it's something we have to choose to do.\nIt is the same in the real world. There are many people who are talking\u2014even crying\u2014but without someone to listen to them, they become background noise. Diminished until forgotten.\nCyborg\nWhat does it take to mend divisions? To recover from violence and manipulation? To accept the monstrosity within yourself and acknowledge the humanity in others?\nA lot of therapy ;)\nBut really, I do believe that there is hope for a better world on the other side of this. \nHorror movies and monster stories are tools we can use to educate ourselves in relative safety. We can explore our weak points and vulnerabilities. We can identify where we have made mistakes or even hurt others. We can use these stories to make changes.\nSee, speak, and hear no evil is not about ignorance and na\u00efvet\u00e9. It's about refusing to see humans as evil, speaking against the evil of manipulation and oppression, and hearing others as they try to escape the evil that plagues their lived experience.\nI believe in humanity\u2014it's the best and the worst of all of us\u2014and it gets better when we lean into it, rather than away from it.\nHowever you vote, never forget your humanity and the humanity of others.\nIn case you're wondering, I voted for Harris.\n Tags: "}, {"title": "The Crime of Consistency", "category": "Newsletters", "href": "/newsletters/the-crime-of-consistency/", "body": " \u00b6 Hailed always as a virtue, consistency provides us with a lot of value in our social systems. No doubt we need consistency in our work ethic to keep things running, we need consistency in the application of laws to be able to trust the system, we need consistency in order to form deep bonds with one another.\nBut is there a catch?\nAn Attitude Change\nIn 1959, Leon Festinger and J. Merrill Carlsmith ran an experiment. A participant coming to the lab would be given two tasks: one for the first half-hour and the other for the last. Refilling trays with spools and turning wooden pegs on a board were the mundane assignments.\nWe'll follow the experience of a single participant\u2014we'll call him Jerry\u2014so we can keep track of what's going on.\nAfter doing the two tasks for an entire hour, Jerry emerges exceptionally bored and happy to not have to do tasks like those again.\nThe experimenter then comes in and \u201creveals\u201d that the point of the study was to see if the performance of the tasks was affected if people were told beforehand that they are fun and enjoyable.\nThere was also a problem, the experimenter confides. The research assistant didn\u2019t show, so the experimenter asks if Jerry could tell the next person in line that he had just finished the task (truth) and that it was really fun (lie). There would be compensation, of course, for sticking around and helping prime the next person.\nThe person Jerry lied to then goes to do their tasks and once they are finished, Jerry gets interviewed to see how fun he really thought the tasks were.\nThe variable in this experiment is that some people were promised $20 to lie to the next participant, some were promised $1, and there was a control group where there was no payment and no need to lie.\nWe know that the tasks were very dull (and long), so by the end of the two-hour experiment, would you be surprised if the attitude towards the task was influenced by the amount of money promised?\nWhich amount made people rate the tasks as more interesting: the $1 group or the $20 group? Take a look at the results:\n\n    \n\nSurprisingly enough, the $1 group was staggeringly more convinced that the tasks were fun and enjoyable.\nWhat caused this drastic attitude shift? Cognitive dissonance.\nThe non-control groups had to do something to justify or rationalize the lie they expressed. The $20 group still shows an attitude shift, but remains on the more honest\u2014or at least consistent\u2014side.\nThe $1 group appears to have shifted their attitude because the monetary reward was not enough to justify their actions. Changing your mind turns out to be an easy way to get rid of the discomfort of being out of alignment.\n\u201cIt actually was really nice to do something meditative,\u201d someone might have said. \u201cIt was a refreshing break,\u201d or \u201cI love playing with blocks!\u201d others could have told themselves.\nHowever you do it, the cognitive dissonance is what is driving you to find a reason for feeling, doing, or believing one way, then contradicting that with our behavior.\nLeon Festinger\u2019s cognitive dissonance theory suggests that \u201calthough we may appear logical in our thinking and behavior, we often engage in seemingly irrational behavior to maintain cognitive consistency. It also describes and predicts how we spend much of our time\u00a0rationalizing\u00a0our behavior rather than actually engaging in rational action.\u201d\u00a0Social Psychology (Fifth Edition), Stephen L. Franzoi, pg. 162\n*This entire section references the study described in* Social Psychology (Fifth Edition), Stephen L. Franzoi, *since I was unable to obtain a copy of the actual study. Chart is redrawn and stylized using similar proportions as found on Figure 5.4, page 163.*\nMirage\nOne of the most common virtues we seem to seek is consistency. We want to know that something will work when we use it. We want to know you\u2019ll show up\u2014and keep showing up. We want leaders who will be predictably consistent in their views and actions.\nVariables are risky.\nThe paradox is not that consistency is both bad and good. It\u2019s that consistency is developed through variability.\nTake a look at defense attorneys. In the U.S., the 6th Amendment of the Constitution guarantees the right to a fair trial with \u201cthe Assistance of Counsel\u201d for defense. This right also includes an \u201cimpartial jury.\u201d\nThere is something admirable about the ethics of defense lawyers. You don\u2019t get to defend only the innocent. You will defend guilty people. What is admirable is how these lawyers do their best to remove their personal feelings and try to let the law reveal what needs to be revealed. Perhaps that is a guilty verdict. Perhaps that is a mistrial, or an affirmation of innocence.\nOne of the greatest demonstrations of impartiality is being able to rule against your own personal beliefs when doing so is the right thing to do. Judges must do this, Supreme Court Justices are\u00a0supposed\u00a0to do this.\nConsistency in these cases is not about always taking the same stance in every situation. It\u2019s actually about the flexibility to be able to apply the appropriate action in every situation. It\u2019s a consistent inconsistency.\n(Makes me wonder how the cognitive dissonance theory maps to those specific roles and careers?)\nThe Bias of Bias\nI\u2019m so often caught in binaries\u2014thinking of the world in terms of two options: on or off. Yes or no. Good or bad. Black or white.\nIn theory, we can draw out models and make arguments for these binary systems, but in practice, there is so much more \u201cgray\u201d than we admit. We live as complex beings within complex systems, and although merisms and polarity can help us understand things more quickly at first, the more we explore, the more nuance we'll find.\n\n    \n    \"All of this is gray\" referring to a gradient from white to black, where only the white and black slivers are excluded from the designation of \"gray.\"\n\nThe real crime of consistency is the false advertising. It\u2019s a great factor in how we can judge something\u2019s value or trustworthiness. It can\u2019t be the only factor, because it hides so much.\nWe see this through technology all of the time, especially with social media. The \u201cInstagram\u201d life illustrates it well: always happy, beautiful, perfect. Filtered indeed.\nCognitive dissonance theory implies that though we may perceive this \u201cconsistency\u201d as an observer, we are not perceiving all of the rationalization that is happening in order to appear consistent.\nThe more I explore topics like this regarding psychology and human behavior, the more I\u2019m realizing that the binary of \u201cgood or bad\u201d just doesn\u2019t serve me well. I feel inclined to shame-based judgment of rationalization to rid ourselves of cognitive dissonance, but that\u2019s overly self-righteous and hypocritical.\nInstead, what is needed is an awareness of these tendencies, biases, logical fallacies, etc. Then we need an acceptance that these things will be reflected in ourselves. After all, there's a reason these things occur\u2014they may not be helpful all of the time, but for whatever reason, they benefited the brain in some way. Now it's up to us to decide when to go deeper, when to take shortcuts, when to change.\nIronically, just knowing about biases or fallacies does not prevent us from falling into them. It does provide us with excellent prompts for introspection, though.\nEven knowing that we are fallible, that we may be wrong, but that we\u2019re still here and still trying is powerful. We learn, we adapt, we change over time. Change is the actual goal.\nIt's consistent inconsistency.

It's very difficult to find that balance, let alone maintain it.\nLooking at this as a puzzle to be solved\u2014because I do think it's possible and even necessary to work on this integration of humanity and technology\u2014there are some principles I've discovered in the last few months that I think will help.\nSlowing Down\nThree weeks ago, I started having a strange black orb appear in my vision. After the optometrist found nothing wrong with the structure of my eye, another symptom arose: massive pain in/on my nose. It became hard to concentrate. Some days I just couldn't work continuously like I normally could with the fatigue and slight mental fog that settled in as final symptoms.\nI still don't have a clear answer to what is going on, but this was a major setback to me. When I don't feel well, I don't work well. When I don't work well, I feel even worse (mentally and physically).\nThe value of rest is so high, but it feels like an exorbitant cost. \nWe've explored in past CYBORG_ issues the need for rest so that your brain can perform at its best. Taking breaks can help you find breakthroughs in difficult problems. Rest is the most crucial component in the formula for performance.\nWhy, then, is it just so hard to take those breaks and rest?\nCultural pressures, childhood experiences, beliefs, values, addiction. All of these can play a role in our need to work and be productive incessantly. But productivity is not a human thing\u2014not really.\nI picked up Cal Newport's newest book, &quot;Slow Productivity,&quot; and was surprised to find a few ideas that elaborate on this issue.\nNewport's thesis is that knowledge workers don't even know what &quot;productivity&quot; actually is since there's no consistent definition, rather, lots of different ideas that are almost like job descriptions. The reason that matters is that productivity is now some arbitrary thing we're all chasing, but aren't making much progress on.\nSlowing down, as it turns out, might just be the way to break through our current barriers to &quot;success&quot; or &quot;accomplishment&quot; or whatever the outcome is for your version of productivity.\nTwo of his ideas are worth highlighting: \n\nWork at a human pace\nFocus on quality\n\nWork at a Human Pace\nThe trap I fall into the most is trying to outpace myself. If I can just automate this or learn all of these other things or put in one more hour, I'll finally get where I want to be.\nIt already doesn't work and when I have a health concern pop up, it really grinds down my momentum and motivation.\nMy mistake has been trying to work like a machine. I'm not a machine, I'm a human. We have myths and stories and even current news reports that express how feeble human work is when compared to machine work (assuming equal jobs).\nThe legend of John Henry racing a steam-powered drill to compare man-power against machine-power in digging through a mountain is a tragedy in my view. Yet, it's the path I've been on for far too long.\nNewport's reminder to work at a human pace is painful. It flies in the face of advertisements, culture, and news that make it seem like the world will leave you behind at any second if you don't know how to code in the latest framework or you don't have the 25.1.1.1.3 version of the iPhone.\nWhat I've seen work for me is to focus on today, and trust in the compound effect\u2014the idea that effort consistently applied builds over time until eventually it turns into a mass greater than could be anticipated.\nCompounding means I do what I can today\u2014even if it is insignificant in comparison to other days. This is how I learned to code. I started with HTML (content-formatting code for websites), then I looked for ways to automate something extremely simple, which lead me to python (a scripting language). Over time and many scripts (automations) later, I now have a decent grasp on how to build professional products and websites.\nBootcamps won't do it. &quot;Tutorial hell&quot; on YouTube won't do it.\nIt's about time and effort, consistently applied, at your pace\u2014a human pace. \nFocus on Quality\nIn application, a focus on quality assists us with the human pace we just discussed.\nThis may be the only space left for humans to land in the AI-saturated world that is coming upon us. \nGenerated articles, summaries, and imagery from AI are quickly losing their novelty. The influx of these products is cheapening the content we have access to in our digital spaces.\nThis is humanity's time to shine!\nAn intense focus on the quality of our work is now, more than ever, the way to stand out of the masses of average work.\nThe only way to accomplish this is by slowing down to a human pace and making the hard decisions for what to devote your quality-focused effort to. \nWe all have a lot to do both at work and at home. Not everything can have our top-tier efforts, so we have to be strategic.\nAt work, I have two objectives that I want to stand out as true quality: \n\nBuilding the best CMS that allows marketers to have enough flexibility of content within brand and design guidelines.\nLearning and implementing practices or techniques that make our websites accessible to anyone, regardless of ability.\n\nBy focusing on my first objective, I've alleviated a lot of the grunt work that tends to be shoved onto marketing developers (aka changing text all day). This allowed me to take on my second objective, but only after the quality of the first reached a certain threshold.\nIt's been a long, hard journey, but I've built something massive in just a few years' time, all on my own.\nCyborg\nSlowing down is not rewarding in the short-term. It may even feel like a waste\u2014which is how I described last weekend.\nMonday, however, I got to work, facing a complicated, leftover problem from Friday. I assumed this problem would take another full day to solve, but, as it tends to happen after a significant break, the solution was quickly uncovered within the first ten minutes of work.\nBreaks and rest help us to process things, to restart with a fresh outlook, to rebuild our stamina.\nScaling back down to a human pace and focusing on real quality is how I have recaptured my satisfaction with work and how I have taken the sting off of my anxiety about the fast-paced treadmill we call technology. Tags: "}, {"title": "Practical Focus", "category": "Newsletters", "href": "/newsletters/practical-focus/", "body": " \u00b6 We talked last week about some theory and strategy behind achieving focus in a noisy world. \nOur principal strategy is still about cutting out options, distractions, decisions. The less we have to choose from, the easier it is to act.\nNow it's time to get practical. Here are three ways I've found to be very effective in helping me focus.\n1. The Tomato Technique\nTaking rests is crucial to maintaining our focus and energy\u2014our overall well-being, really. The hard part is getting back into the groove after a break. The pomodoro method is one way to help with this. \n(FYI, pomodoro means tomato in Italian. Francesco Cirillo, the inventor of this method, named it after a tomato-shaped kitchen timer that he used.)\nHow To\nIt goes like this:\n\nChoose a specific task\u2014what you want to accomplish or at least work on during this time.\nSet a timer for 25 minutes\u2014this is your all-in work time. Only work on that task you chose.\nOnce the timer runs out, take a 5-minute break.\n\nRepeat this cycle for 4 sessions, then take a longer break.\nYou can find more information on the official Pomodoro Technique website.\nPros and Cons\nThis has been a great technique for me to add in some structure to complicated tasks. With coding, sometimes a problem feels so confusing or even feels so huge that it keeps me from starting.\nSetting the timer helps my brain focus on one task and since it's finite, I can more easily dive in because I know that the &quot;pain&quot; will end. \nMy main critique of this method is that it does not reduce my stress as much as the method claims. Part of that is my personality. Part of that is feeling like I'm back in school, taking a test and the ever-present consciousness of time creates its own distraction from my task.\nSo I found a modification to this...\n2. Hourglass\nCombine an ancient technology with modern technology and you've got a sweet spot.\n\n    \n    Hourglass next to my keyboard and mouse.\n\nI was extremely stressed at work two years ago. I had a tyrant manager that weighed on my days and nights. I wasn't sleeping well, I wasn't working well, I wasn't feeling well.\nIn my desperation to find ways to calm my anxiety and reconnect with my focus and productivity, I received a beautiful hourglass filled with black sand for my birthday.\nThe soothing, subtle sounds of tiny grains of sand running through the narrow funnel and piling at the bottom made this hourglass mesmerizing. It acted as both a meditation device and eventually a productivity enhancement.\nI started the hourglass with the same intent as the pomodoro technique: to work for the whole time the sand was running, which was about 20 minutes.\nIt had the same effect, but something about the subtle end of the hourglass made the process so much less stressful. There's no jarring beeps or dings or alarm-music when an hourglass timer runs out.\nIt simply stops in the background and allows you to either notice and stop, or slowly wind down your task.\nFor my highly anxious mind at the time, this was the perfect modification to help me initiate my focus without over-burdening my mental space.\nPros and Cons\nIf you have a task where you absolutely need to know how much time you have left, the classic pomodoro technique will work better. It's tough to tell what time is remaining with an hourglass, since all you can do is compare how much sand is at the top and bottom.\nYou also have to have an hourglass for this to work...but there are ways around this.\nOtherwise, I believe this method is superior if you're struggling with anxiety or if you're already in a stressed state.\n3. Desktop Meditation\nAs noted earlier, part of focus is having good rest. Jumping on Facebook or whatever social media app on your phone between tasks is an awful way to rest. It feels good, but it takes a toll since your mind isn't really resting.\nThere a several great ways to facilitate a good break: taking a walk or doing some other movements and physical activity are the best. \nThe point is doing something distinct and also something where you really aren't using your brain the way you do for your tasks at work.\n\nCh. 11 Dao De Jing - Translated by Roger Ames &amp; David L. Hall\n&quot;Thus, it might be something that provides the value, but it is nothing that provides the utility.&quot;\n\nNothingness provides utility. Dao De Jing is referring to containers or pots in that passage, but it also applies to our minds. The product of our thinking is valuable, but it is the breaks and rest that provides the utility of (or the access to) our productive thinking.\nHere are a two more ways I've found helpful in creating restful space\u2014especially on a time crunch, in limited space, and/or in a stressed state.\nZen Garden\nI grabbed a small wooden box, lined it with plastic wrap, and dumped in some crafting sand I had laying around. I cleared off space on my computer desk for my mini sandbox. Using a small stone, I began to draw patterns in the sand.\nSomething about watching the sand move and tumble is relaxing, just like it was with the hourglass.\nI spent only a few minutes tracing temporary lines and I was already in love with this technique.\n\n    \n    My mini-sandbox / zen garden\n\nMeditation is a hard practice. We know it has benefits, but setting aside the time to just sit and breathe is tough. This form of kinetic meditation, though, is a lot easier to access in my experience.\nWhen I could feel my emotions starting drive my actions at work, I would stop and pick up my stone and doodle some lines in my zen garden.\nIt's a powerful way to reset focus, to calm anxiety, and facilitate real rest.\nDrawing\nIf you don't have the space or the sand for a zen garden, a simple pad of paper and a pen can take its place.\nDoodling is essentially what I was doing in the sand, so doing the same thing on paper should work in a similar manner.\nDrawing like this isn't about artistic expression or &quot;being good.&quot; It's just a way to let go, occupy your hands, and let your mind rest by changing up the scene. \nIronically, as an artist, I've found doodling to be a difficult thing to do, which is why I appreciated this video where Jazza, a YouTube artist, explores different doodling techniques. Maybe one of them can help you out if you want to try doodling but don't know how to start.\nCyborg\nInitiating focus, retaining focus, and resting to replenish focus is tough in a noisy world. \nSometimes we even sabotage our own attempts at staying focused by being too worried about our focus\u2014kinda like when you're laying in bed telling yourself, &quot;Come on, go to sleep, I need to sleep.&quot;\nThere are many more tips and tricks out there, but remember that more options harms our ability to act. So, consider the things you've already done that help you focus and stick to those.\nOr, give a shot to one of the methods we discussed here. Just make sure you only try one thing. \nFocus and decision-making are similar skills. Let's do this.

Is anxiety a constant companion? What if we could tap into more of the brain's pre-existing power?\nThis CYBORG_ issue is more of a challenge to you.\nIt's almost the end of the first quarter of the year, so it's a good time to do some reflection and shake things up. \nThe Problem\nOur brains collect so much junk over time that it interferes with our focus, our productivity, and our default ruminations. &quot;Cognitive offloading&quot; will empty the garbage can in our minds and open up space for clarity, purpose, and intention.\n\nWhen thoughts are transferred onto paper, it reduces the need for the brain to expend energy to retain and juggle the information. This is known as cognitive offloading.\n\u2014Rian Doris\n\nI'm not a therapist, but I have received recommendations from therapists to try externalizing my thoughts when I'm anxious or have &quot;big emotions.&quot;\nJournalling, rage-writing, drawing, anything to get my mind to release the need to spiral in these thoughts or worries.\nGetting things out of your mind and into a safe place\u2014whether so you can recall the thing or just process without anyone else accessing it\u2014is a beautiful way to reset.\nYour Task\nGoal: externalize your thoughts so your mind doesn't need to work so hard to keep them in memory.\nWrite down literally everything in your mind for a couple of hours: \n\nworries\nregrets\ndumb ideas\ngood ideas\nunclosed loops\nconversations you've been thinking about for years\nprocrastinated to-dos\nrandom facts\nwords that keep repeating\nliterally anything else rattling in your brain\n\nI've done this once before at this larger scale of really dedicating time to brain dump, and I was surprised at how refreshing it was. I used technology (software and hardware) to capture these these thoughts so that I can go back to them if I need to.\nBackground\nThis idea came from Rian Doris, a masterful teacher on the flow state. You can watch his explanation of this process and some of the science behind rumination here: How To Tap Into Your Intuition and Unleash Your Genius [24 minutes]\nIn the video, he said he likes to do this exercise for 10 days every quarter!\nThat might be a bit more than most people can ever do. So, I propose it's more manageable to do something like this for an hour or two each quarter. Do what works for you.\nBalance\nLike everything, there are negative consequences, so we'll want to do this knowing both the benefits and the drawbacks.\nThis was a great scholarly article outlining cognitive offloading\u2014what we know, what we don't know:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6942100/#:~:text=Cognitive%20offloading%20refers%20to%20the,a%20cell%20phone%20or%20computer.\nWhat I took away from the article is the intuitive sense that if we externalize the information we would've had to hold onto in our brain, we risk poorer recall when we don't have access to that information later. That info has been offloaded; delegated to something else.\nIt's the classic phone number problem. We probably know some phone numbers by heart (childhood family phone, perhaps?), but we don't know most of our friends' and neighbors' phone numbers anymore. \nWhy bother putting it to memory, when we have smart phones that store all the contact info for hundreds of people?\nAnd then there's that one time you left or lost your phone and you need to call someone...\nPKM\nI'm still a big believer in personal knowledge management (PKM), which is a form of cognitive offloading. Something like Obsidian is a great way of offloading the technical details that don't generally serve you when you're away from the computer.\nAnd sometimes the intrusive ruminations\u2014the persistent thoughts we want to get rid of or at least want to calm\u2014are exactly what we should offload.\nAs a teen, I remember trying something new one night when I was worried about something and couldn't fall asleep. I reached for my marker and wrote a scrawling note on my white board by my bed.\nNow that my brain knew I was taking this thing seriously, and that I had it somewhere I wouldn't miss, it could finally rest.\nBraintenance won't always be about improving task performance. Sometimes it's just a process of telling your brain, &quot;I've got you.&quot; Tags: PKM"}, {"title": "The Price of Knowledge", "category": "Newsletters", "href": "/newsletters/the-price-of-knowledge/", "body": "The hidden costs of human knowledge and how our reliance on technology may be reshaping memory and understanding. \u00b6 The depth of human knowledge is staggeringly profound.\nMedical science gives us the ability to manage or cure diseases that used to be death sentences. \nInformation technology like radio, phone, and internet connect us across distance.\nPolitical sciences help us theorize and construct collaborative efforts between and within groups of people.\nArt and humanities create influence and change behaviors.\nI would bet that the knowledge you have cultivated over time has deep meaning and application in the greater scope of &quot;humanity.&quot; I don't know if there is knowledge too insignificant.\nThere is caution to be had, however, in the constant seeking of novelty that our brains engage in. I believe some of our technology has become a barrier to knowledge because it has cheapened the knowledge itself.\nKnowledge is Costly\nHave you ever wondered how we figured out how vaccines work? What about healing an infection, or safely moving an injured body without causing more harm, or any number of medical treatments?\nThe history of Western medical advancement is plagued (forgive the pun) with experimentation close to torture(1), brutality, classism, racism(2), and ethically questionable acts.\nMy point is not to demonize medical history\u2014especially because it's not unique. Every field, every advancement, every body of knowledge shares the guilt of exploitation, racism, and ultimately suffering.\nWe may be separated from the costs of our knowledge. Past sins from distant people in time and geography. But the price was still paid, even if it was thousands of years ago.\nI think we owe it to people who have paid the price for our knowledge to hold that knowledge with reverence and gratitude.\nJust Google It\nHow often do you reach for your phone to do a quick search on something? How many times throughout the day are we using search engines to answer questions we can figure out ourselves given a few moments' thought?\nThe &ldquo;Google Effect,&rdquo; is when people go to Google (insert any search engine here) as a source of knowledge\u2014and they turn to it rather than just remembering something.\nIn a lot of ways, this isn't all that striking\u2014much like an encyclopedia, we come to know a certain book has some knowledge and we would return to that encyclopedia when we need to extract that knowledge. At least, that's how we did it before the encyclopedia was indexed by Google ;)\nThis is also a reflection of the Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) systems we've talked about building in Obsidian or other platforms here on CYBORG_. PKM systems have been monumentally helpful to me, but they do come with costs.\nA meta-analysis (a study of studies), Google effects on memory, has some helpful hints to what's happening and provides some insight on the pros and cons:\n\n    \n        &quot;...when people anticipate future access to information, they have lower information memory rates and a better recall of where to obtain the information.&quot; \n    \n    (3, Google effects on memory)\n\nMeaning when we know / plan that we can find that information in a specific place in the future, we tend to prefer to remember where to find it rather than remembering the information itself.\nWhether it's your personal PKM system or Google or even another website, the lesson here is that this does impact our knowledge (and our perception of our own knowledge).\n\n    Internet users...may believe that they are particularly adept at thinking and remembering information, despite the fact that the Internet is increasingly responsible for 'remembering' information. (3)\n\nUltimately, as long as we know this is happening\u2014that we are choosing to offload knowledge to an external source\u2014we are set up to be able to treat our knowledge with good judgment. \nIs this piece of information worth spending some time with and committing it to real memory? Is it something I can be ok with losing if the external source goes away? Is it worth taking a moment to think through just because you can?\n\n    ...by examining the potential costs and limitations of the Internet, individuals are in a better position to develop and modify the technology so that it is potentially more productive, less disruptive, and more consistent with the everyday goals and functions of human cognition. (3)\n\nHonor Your Knowledge\nThe longer it's been since college, the more precious the things I learned there have become to me. There was a period of time immediately after graduating that I resented my education, because I didn't feel like it was good enough; it wasn't applicable.\nNow, I see that all of the knowledge gained was hard won and it has remained, at least in part, with me. And the parts that have decayed with time are things that I can go back to and refresh my knowledge\u2014even update it with more current information.\nSimply reading the scholarly article mentioned in the last section was an ignition of memories from my Psychology classes. Writing papers about experiments performed on a rat or observing people cross streets without a glance to check for cars.\nThere are discrete skills that I gained from the previous work I put in. I am not a psychologist\u2014I'm not even a Graphic Designer (my actual degree)\u2014but the knowledge somehow finds its way into my life, enriching it, clarifying it, and sometimes making it more difficult (it can't be all rainbows, right?).\nThe cost of knowledge is great. Don't let the ease of the Google search fool you.\nHumanity's knowledge is a beautiful, terrible compound built on work and pain.\nNext time you pull out your phone to do some calculations for a recipe (how much flour if it's a 1 1/2 batch?) or look up a word (define: exegesis) or try to figure out if your symptoms mean you have an ingrown hair or the bubonic plague...consider a pause to reflect how much knowledge is right there.\nDiscovery, records, reviews, updates, publishing all were phases that brought that knowledge to your thumb. How will you honor that?\nFootnotes\n(1) Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers, Mary Roach\n(2) How Belgian Imperialism Gave Us The COVID Vaccine, Johnny Harris, YouTube\n(3) Google effects on memory: a meta-analytical review of the media effects of intensive Internet search behavior, Chen Gong and Yang Yang, 2024 Tags: "}, {"title": "Don't Be the Process", "category": "Newsletters", "href": "/newsletters/dont-be-the-process/", "body": "Automation techniques even the least technical person can use. \u00b6 Most of our work is encased in processes.\nStep 1.

Do your creative/unique/custom thing\nStep 3. finish like this.\nThe procedural steps where order matters or where things get complex are the ideal places to optimize and offload.\nSince being diagnosed with MS, I\u2019ve become acutely sensitive to my energy levels. Energy management has become my main focus in designing better systems for how I work.\nMy biggest mistakes have been the times when I\u2019ve acted like I am the process, rather than creating the process.\nProcess Making\nIf you\u2019ve been the go-to person at work for something, you start to be naturally molded into the process. However, this is a mistake both for you and the business, because you may not always be available or perhaps will not stay at the company at some point.\nBusinesses lose lots of momentum with the loss of long-term employees, because they take their knowledge with them.\nWherever applicable, I recommend developing SOPs for your work\u2014this becomes a way for you to offload some of the lift and also is a gift you can give to your company when you leave.\nAn SOP is a \u201cStandard Operating Procedure,\u201d and it\u2019s basically a checklist or outline of some business process. Whether you\u2019ve had one given to you, or you\u2019ve internalized one for the task at hand, you are using SOPs in your work all the time.\nIf you\u2019re a developer, do you use git to push code changes to a certain repo? Do you do a QA check at some point? Are there certain things that have to be done before your changes go live? That\u2019s probably an SOP.\nIf you\u2019re a designer, do you choose a canvas size for a new graphic? Do you export your images with certain settings for a specific place? Do you always start with wireframes and have check-ins before creating the hi-res mock-up? Those are SOPs.\nIf you\u2019re a marketer, do you create reports for the end of the month? Do you prepare requests for website work by gathering images and content and then submitting a proposal? Those are SOPs.\nIt\u2019s how the work gets done\u2014and usually it\u2019s how the work gets done specifically at your company, because workflows often vary from team to team, at least in the details.\nDon\u2019t Be an SOP\nHere\u2019s where we have a major productivity boosting potential: creating the SOPs, rather than internalizing them.\nYou have a limited capacity for decision making, task switching, and memory. There are constraints we face as humans day-to-day, and especially if you have other impacting factors with health, disability, or any number of things.\nThe intuitive way you do things is not always the most effective. That\u2019s the problem with defaulting to the internalized SOP\u2014it\u2019s hard to examine, it only surfaces when you\u2019re doing those tasks, and you\u2019re forced to make lots of tiny decisions about how to accomplish the task over and over again.\nLet\u2019s revisit the process and find spots to develop our SOP.\nCreate the SOP\nWrite it out\nFirst, we\u2019re going to write out that intuitive process\u2014start with a simple task first.\nWrite down each step you take as you take it.\nExamine your process\nNow we have our SOP base and we can look for ways to optimize.\nYou could create templates or write down notes on how to create something consistently (code snippets, design files, spreadsheets with formulas).\nThere may be ways to prepare information in a better way before the process. Maybe there\u2019s a shortcut, or something that can be removed entirely.\nOptimize and Update\nNow that you\u2019ve seen your process, take control and make it better.\nTest it out\u2014next time you perform this task, follow your SOP instead of doing it intuitively. The idea is that someone else should get the same result by following the guide you\u2019ve created.\nIf you forgot something or parts of it seem clunky, revise it.\nMake it findable\nPut that SOP somewhere you\u2019ll find it again and pull it out every time you need to do that task. Now you can zoom through it.\nIf your company provides a wiki or some other knowledge base, put it where others can find it.\nWhen to SOP\nObviously, you don\u2019t have to create an SOP for literally every task that you do at work. Some tasks really are too simple and are intuitive enough after getting familiar with the process.\nI tend to create SOPs when a task is:\n\ninfrequent, but high-stakes\ntedious or complex\nand / or takes too much energy to remember specifics or details\n\nHere\u2019s an example I recently did for my home insurance that checks all of those boxes.\nDue to some silly (and highly inefficient) rules with my mortgage and my HOA, I have to send proof of insurance that my HOA provides over to my mortgage company every year.\nThe first couple of years I would get a threatening letter reminding me I needed to do this, and I would have to dig through a bunch of papers to find the insurance carrier contact info.\nAfter the first year, I had to find the previous year\u2019s email to the insurance since it had the details of what information the carrier would need from me.\nThen I would wait for the email back with a PDF that I then had to upload to my mortgage company\u2019s website on some random page that, again, I had to look up.\nThis is the perfect task for an SOP, even though it\u2019s not work-related. It has to be done every year. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to remember everything, especially the contact and request info that I have to send.\nThis is how I solved it:\nEach year, I have an email automatically send to my insurance carrier, pre-populated with the information I need to send.\nInstead of a threatening letter in my real mailbox alerting me it\u2019s time to do this, I see an email reply from my insurance company. That\u2019s my trigger to go look up this SOP in Obsidian, my favorite tool for knowledge management.\nThen I download the PDF, click on the link in my notes, auto-fill the form and upload the PDF.\nThe last step is to create next year\u2019s email and schedule it to send in one year and I\u2019m done.\nCyborg\nI went from a stressed out, week long process to a 10 minute process that accomplished everything I needed ahead of schedule.\nUltimately, you have the opportunity in most things to control your process. Wherever you have that control, try and refine the process. Write it out. Test it. Automate parts of it\u2014or the entire thing.\nYou are human, after all, and that means you have unique creative, strategic, and visionary capabilities.\nDon\u2019t divert the energy that could go towards those capabilities. Let the easily repeatable, tedious, or administrative tasks be done by a computer or by a streamlined, easy-to-follow SOP that you\u2019ve created and refined.

Either performing some street magic or at a show?\nHow is it that in the 21st century, magicians are still fooling people?\nMagic may be one of the most fascinating subjects to explore throughout human history. It has accompanied us for many thousands of years (if not all the way back to the beginning).\nWe can explain things now\u2014especially the magic that has separated itself from religious or spiritual contexts. Yet, even with all of the knowledge of neuroscience and cognition, we\u2019re still fooled by a good trick.\nThe job, according to magician, Chris Ramsay, is to create a safe environment for the audience to have a transformative experience. It has to be \u201csafe\u201d because the magician is asking the audience to suspend their belief. They\u2019re going to perceive things that seem to break the rules of the natural world.\nThe Rules\nThe more I create systems in code, the more sensitive I am to the other kinds of systems there are in the real world.\n\n    \n\nUltimately, systems are just a collection of decisions. There is no magic to it\u2026well, maybe a little magic.\nSome systems are held together by an ephemeral substance we call \u201ctrust.\u201d In fact, many of our social systems are completely reliant on trust, so much so that we can forget that the system is quite fragile\u2014until someone breaks it.\nWhether it\u2019s a crime or even a betrayal, the breaking of a trust-based system is shocking and confusing. We can be utterly stunned as we watch something that seemed solid and sturdy burn to the ground and crumble into dust.\nWe may ask ourselves: how could we have been fooled? What did we miss?\nJust like the magic show, we came to our system with a set of rules that seemed so intuitive or so untouchable as to not even be present in our minds. The breaking of trust can feel like deep deception.\nWe may attempt to puzzle out what happened: looking at all the pieces, scrutinizing every word, trying to retain everything we saw. The problem is that to discover the trick behind the magic or the betrayal lurking behind the system is a problem of attention.\nThe Methods\nIf you want to deceive someone, one of the easiest ways is to distract them from what you are really doing.\nAs Chris Ramsay would say, \u201cThe bigger motion covers the smaller one.\u201d\nWe see this in social systems all of the time. Corruption sneaks in behind favors and friendships and shared beliefs. Complacency casts shadows over the areas where change is happening so that we simply can\u2019t perceive it\u2014especially in contrast to the shining thing in the spotlight.\nReasonable minds have posited that the recent U.S. election was about democracy, but the masses thought it was about the economy or abortion or other inflammatory topics that are easier and more accessible to argue about.\nThe methods of deception are many and varied. Every single one of us has been, is currently, and will be deceived about something\u2014even many things.\nThe Reveal\nIf magic is deception, how can the magic show really be about having a\u00a0transformative\u00a0experience as Ramsay insists?\nFirst, we have to remove a common trap that modern audiences fall into: thinking they know how the trick is done. The moment we think we\u2019ve got it figured out is the moment we stop perceiving information. We may stop listening, looking, or even stop being present in the moment.\nWe may be so focused on proving that the magician is using wires that we don\u2019t notice the smoke and mirrors. We may even be playing into the deception of the trick itself\u2014we\u2019re\u00a0supposed\u00a0to think it\u2019s wires.\nThe best experiences I\u2019ve had with magic are the times I\u2019ve allowed myself to suspend belief, to stop explaining and to start listening. The art behind the magic is ideally designed to cause us to question, rather than to answer.\nWhile a magic show is still entertainment, and the real-world deception is devastating, the ideal outcome is to be transformed by the experience. Hopefully once the deception in our social systems is revealed, we are able to make changes and improvements. Hopefully we stay in a mindset of curiosity, rather than become hardened in stubbornness or trauma.\nTransformation can be a relief or an invitation for more pain. Take your time. Update your beliefs when better information is found.\nWe can\u2019t eradicate deception, but we can change ourselves.\n Tags: "}, {"title": "Intolerable Satisfaction", "category": "Newsletters", "href": "/newsletters/intolerable-satisfaction/", "body": "Are the incentives we currently have in business and society at large fundamentally flawed? \u00b6 Remember the days when you bought video games that came on CDs (or even cartridges!) and you would play them on a console that was not connected to the Internet? Or maybe you remember the pre-subscription era of Adobe where buying the Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign) was a few thousand dollars, but once it was installed, it just worked\u2014you could get by for quite a few years without another purchase.\nApparently, we're in a software crisis, again. I've heard the complaint in many venues lately that software is just expected to be buggy and barely accomplish what you need it to do. This expectation may not be limited to just software. We can see it in things like the content on social media: empty videos that grab attention, but don't deliver anything meaningful, thoughtful, or actionable. I think there is something going on culturally that lends a hand to this issue of quality: intolerable satisfaction.\nThere are two ways we can think of this:\n\nSatisfaction with the intolerable\nAn overabundance of satisfaction to the point that we cannot tolerate it\n\nBroken Standards\nAs a developer, I am confounded and amazed at industrial designers, mechanical engineers, and others whose work deals in real, physical products. I have so long been trained on the flexible and forgiving medium that is website development that the thought of making something in real life seems arduous.\n&quot;You mean that when you designed that [notebook, microphone, waterbottle, insert product here], you had everything worked out before you sold it to someone?!&quot;\nIt is impressive to be able to create something to be used that will work out-of-the-box, because that means you have thoroughly tested how the thing works, you have painstakingly worked out any issues, and your product can live up to its marketed promises.\nGranted, nothing is perfect\u2014and I am assuming a lot about the product development (they are actually testing the final product, right?). It's just that software products can hide a multitude of sins by having such short iteration cycles. If you mess up something that is physical, you'll have to remake the whole thing. You can't just take it back to your shop really quick before the customer notices something was broken, but you absolutely can in most parts of the digital world.\nThe famous Silicon Valley slogan of &quot;move fast and break things,&quot; continues to pervade the attitudes of tech companies and product development. So yeah, there will be bugs and you'll be better off just expecting your app to not be perfect, right? I certainly think this expectation has been trained into us over the years: we're desensitized to quality, not because it doesn't exist, but because there is so much distraction, we forget that quality was supposed to matter.\nWe have become satisfied with what was previously intolerable.\nMore, more, more\nIt is disturbing to me that the game played out by the biggest technology companies is essentially a convergence on harvesting human attention.\nSocial media platforms have all started looking pretty similar. Sure, there may be slight &quot;cultural&quot; differences (e.g. LinkedIn is more business, Facebook is more political), but especially in recent years, I've had a harder time distinguishing one venue over the other. On the phone, the experience is virtually the same: short-form vertical video or &quot;carousel&quot; fed to you one after another.\nCreators are now effectively re-posting the exact same stuff on all of their different platforms, meaning that there is no incentive for someone to go to a specific place for a specific reason. Now, you just go to Instagram because the reel for XYZ creator will be the same as it was on TikTok or Twitter (using that name to spite its owner).\nMaybe it's giving me nightmares because I hate the idea of duplicate content\u2014especially at scale\u2014because it feels like such a waste and such an exponential increase in data to sort through. Maybe it's also the implications of what the game really is: Excess.\nIn business, there is a theory that you should choose which game you want to play: the short-game (finite) or the long-game (infinite). The short-game is for fast profit, and it's often characterized by practices that aren't sustainable or scalable\u2014like focusing on aggressive cost-cutting or hitting arbitrary numbers for a quarter. Not much is put into the big-picture strategy, and there are winners (those whose businesses are found superior to competitors) and losers (those whose businesses close).\nThe long-game is lauded as the ideal, because it means that the business leader is always looking to the future, to the next big thing. It's not about winning, because the game isn't supposed to end. It's about accumulating. It's about constant &quot;up and to the right&quot; graphs and profits.\nThe problem is that there is no end. The incentive to accumulate and hoard are not healthy. We've seen exceptionally wealthy individuals turn to destructive or chaotic practices because they have already far surpassed any possibility of being matched. \nHow do you have the will to stop when every game in our society, from owning a business, down to scrolling through social media is demanding more, more, more?\nCyborg\nThis is my personal call to action amidst the backdrop of increasing anxiety and overwhelm. I want to take Cal Newport's advice from his recent book, &quot;Slow Productivity,&quot; to focus on quality. Exceptional quality.\nMaybe AI can eventually get to a place where it can produce high-quality things. Other people are currently producing high-quality things. The issue isn't: can someone/something create a high-quality thing? Rather, it is: Do I want to dedicate time and energy to acquire the skill to create a high-quality thing?\nMaybe other businesses are doggedly chasing the never-closer horizon. I don't have to run my business or my career in that way.\nMaybe other developers or designers are fine with cutting corners, moving fast, and breaking things. I want to practice delivering exceptional quality.\nThere's nothing inherently wrong with big-picture, long-game thinking, but it's easy to lose sight of the actual point of that strategy. It's not about more, it's about better. \nI want to contribute to a healthier humanity, not an intolerable satisfaction. Tags: "}, {"title": "Notification Game", "category": "Newsletters", "href": "/newsletters/notification-game/", "body": "All of those little interruptions may be taking a toll on you\u2014or they are manipulating your behavior. \u00b6 In the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) world, there's one metric that is practically worshipped: usage. Most tech companies have SaaS products, like Photoshop or even ChatGPT. These products often track every action you take while using it: logged in at 6:51, clicked main button, etc. Even when tracking the fewest amount of actions, like only recording how often you log in, that data builds up the product's usage metric.\nIf people are using your product, it must be a good product. That's the theory, anyway. \nThat also creates a game to try and constantly increase those numbers. If people only use it once a week, how can we get them to use it daily? Once they're hooked daily, can we get them to use it every hour?\nNot every product has the addictive power of something like social media (who logs into their project management system when they have some down time?) so they may use other tactics to get you back on the platform. Ever gotten a notification on your phone saying, &quot;Your friend, Jess, is back on Marco Polo&quot;? Or &quot;Check out your Spotify Wrapped&quot;?\nSophisticated products are programmed to notice that you haven\u2019t logged in for a while, then send you these messages on your phone. These little intrusions are designed to get you back on the app.\nSocial platforms like Facebook or even Marco Polo are able to leverage our social psychology to draw us in. Using a name of a friend or even a name that is familiar to us in the context of an app piques our interest, because we are naturally curious about our friends and will want to see what they're doing. Sometimes it happens to be that person you were thinking about reconnecting with, using coincidence (a.k.a. an algorithm's best guess) to increase the gravitational pull to the program. I also wouldn't be surprised if there was a tiny boost of confidence in the app: your friend is using this app, it must be worthwhile\u2014classic social marketing. \nThe Irony\nAll tech companies know about notifications. All of them try to find ways to send notifications. Not all have access to your phone, but perhaps they have your email, or a desktop notification permission, or they may settle for notifications within the app itself. We also know that everyone else knows about notifications, meaning that we need to find ways to notify customers/clients amidst the noise of all of the other notifications.\nThe individual person tends to be averse to the inundation of notifications; quickly swiping them away without reading. Sometimes that's actually a bad thing\u2014ever accidentally dismiss an error notification with important instructions? Anyone? Just me? It really isn't in our best interest as users to develop a notification blindness similar to advertising blindness, which is why generally speaking, tech companies try to be judicious in the amount of notifications they send out (social media is seemingly the greatest exception).\nThere's an artificial conflict created in the midst of all of this noise. We have large entities (the companies) smothering individuals (like you and me) with notifications. Two teams, essentially. One stands to benefit from the notifications exponentially more than the other. \nFunny enough, tech companies sometimes try to create a solution for the mass of notifications we encounter\u2014a solution to a problem they created...snake oil, say what? \nJust a few months ago, the BBC published an article revealing a massive issue with Apple's AI-powered summarization. Apple was trying to be helpful in reducing the amount of notifications by grouping them together and using AI to provide summaries\u2014because we just love summaries. Unfortunately, the AI got some things wrong, like saying that the man arrested for murdering the UHC CEO had died by suicide, which didn't happen.\nAI's hallucinations are not only bad for the brand of the BBC as they've argued\u2014their reputation is vital to being positioned as a rigorous source of reliable reporting\u2014it's also bad for the people who see fake headlines and have no reason to suspect them of being false. Bad enough that some news or other platforms use fake headlines on purpose, when a trustworthy source is made to look like the bottom-of-the-barrel platforms, it can be destructive.\nCyborg\nWhile our smart phones have undoubtedly been useful pocket-sized computers, they've also become our primary notification center. You've likely got your email(s) linked up, plus all of the apps you've installed, all in addition to the texts and calls. Each account or app adding more and more of those little icons or bubbles with numbers that you can only clear by reading or engaging.\nIn an attempt to reduce stress, I aggressively removed the types of notifications I was getting on my phone. Facebook was the worst offender, so I tried to give it the fewest possible permissions. The first month or so was absolute bliss.\nThen I watched things shift.\nI don't know if it's coincidence\u2014perhaps Facebook was updating this notification behavior at the same time\u2014or if it's designed to do this, but the notifications started rolling back en masse. Somehow they're using the permissions they do have to game me\u2014almost like they're taking the category of the allowed notification and stretching it as far as possible to find a message that kinda fits.\nKnowing this, I can clarify a statement I made above. This isn't a game between the two teams: company vs individuals. It's a game the company plays, using us as the pieces.\nThe hardest part about notifications is that sometimes they are really helpful, and even necessary. We get the illusion that some companies are aware of this and are trying to help by splitting out types of notifications that you can toggle on or off. This still allows for &quot;interpretation&quot; on the part of the app or company, as Facebook seems to have done to me.\nThere's no great answer to this, although awareness of this problem can help &quot;debug&quot; other problems we may have on our minds. There's decent evidence that notifications or any other disruptive communication can increase our stress and even the pressure we feel. The study referenced focuses on the workplace, but I've seen these constant streams of beeps and blinks add to my sense of overwhelm.\nInstead of giving random companies permission to have constant, open, one-way communication lines directly to me, I want to engage with them on my terms. I will decide to open that app or use that product when I need to, not when they need me to.\nDrawing boundaries is a skill in developing healthy relationships with people\u2014why not with technology? I'm going to take a moment right now to audit the notifications I allow on my phone\u2014feel free to join me!

But these fears aren't new, nor related to just AI. \u00b6 It's a dark, cold room with a table and a fire. The hostage named Caesar accuses the Colonel, who is standing at the table near the fireplace, of having no mercy. The Colonel looks over his shoulder at the ape who has scrutinized his actions. Eventually he launches into his diatribe:\n&ldquo;Mercy. You have any idea what mercy would do to us?&rdquo; He asks Caesar.\n&ldquo;You're much stronger than we are. You're smart as hell. No matter what you say, you'd eventually replace us. That's the law of nature. The irony is we created you. We tried to defy nature, bend it to our will. Nature has been punishing us for our arrogance ever since.&rdquo;\nThis moment pulled me out of the movie and into reality. Is this just War for the Planet of the Apes? Or is this a human insecurity in the face of our own technology, arrogance, and existence?\nThe AI Question\nEver since the rapid push for AI adoption after ChatGPT's massive and unforeseen success, the question of AI has jumped down our throats. Before, the question could be laughed off as part of silly sci-fi fantasies for nerds to discuss. It's not necessarily a question of whether AI is sentient, and it's not about whether it can do our jobs well enough.\nHowever, these surface-level questions are much easier to distract ourselves with, because there is the possibility of solving for it. We can create regulations to help mitigate unfair or discriminatory working conditions (theoretically, anyway). We have also dealt with AI for a while and it has not come near sentience\u2014it's not alive, it doesn't have feelings. At best it's an illusion helped by our own cognitive biases.\nConsider what Alf Hornborg writes in the research article Objects Don't Have Desires (1):\n\n\n&ldquo;The aspiration of cybernetics to create artificial life has deflected our attention from the skewed political and distributive conditions of technological progress. Blurring the boundary between life and technological nonlife has obscured the widening economic gap between the victims and the beneficiaries of accumulation. As ideologies are prone to do, the image of technology as artificial life mystifies social inequalities by representing them as natural.\n&ldquo;The traditional distinction between nature and artifice goes back to Aristotle. In this tradition, technological artifacts have been understood as generated by the external intentions of their human makers, whereas living organisms are animated by inner purposes that derive from nature, not from humans.&rdquo;\n\n\nProfoundly, Hornborg sums it up: ...Modernity not only transforms nature and humans into instruments, but simultaneously naturalizes technology.\nWe can get so wrapped up in the threat of replacement (which is a valid concern) that we forget about the real, imminent threat to humanity or safety or health, especially affecting our most vulnerable populations. Our own flesh and blood are suffering, and we're worried about whether the chatbot actually knows what it is?\nMaybe the AI illusion is too distracting to get a sense for the deeper question we're looking for. Let's leave the smoke and mirrors for a more encompassing theme:\nThe Technology Question\nFrom the broader strokes of history, technology has accompanied us for tens of thousands of years. Everything from fire to language, tools to weapons. We have stories about our technology\u2014how we received our knowledge from the gods, like Prometheus, or how special weapons could be forged with almost-sentient agency, like the One Ring from The Lord of the Rings.\nSometimes these stories teach us to look at our technology with suspicion: is there a ghost in the machine? Some ulterior motive? Or perhaps the company or other system behind the technology is threatening to our rights, privacy, and humanity (totally valid in the age of social media)?\nSometimes these stories elevate humanity to level with the gods (or even transcend them) as we pull farther away from the need to survive directly in nature.\n\n\n&ldquo;...now that we have technologized our environment and isolated the self within a scientific frame of mind, we no longer turn to nature to echo our state. Now we catch our reflections, even our spirits, in the movements and mentations of machines.&rdquo;\n\n\n    \u2014TechGnosis, by Erik Davis, pg 155\n\n\nThese stories can also place a small seed of terror in the back of our minds (if it's not already there via other means). I suspect many of us have a sense of the conflict we have with nature, even if it's not overt or if we don't acknowledge it very often. \nLike the Colonel said in War for the Planet of the Apes:\n&ldquo;We tried to defy nature, bend it to our will. Nature has been punishing us for our arrogance ever since.&rdquo;\nIs our question about how we played a part, whether directly or indirectly, in devastating effects on the environment? Have we offended Nature itself? Will Nature retaliate at some point to bring things back into balance?\nThe Humanity Question\nIf the question isn't about whether we can create tools that can be agents unto themselves (life where there previously was none), nor about whether we will be replaced by these creations in an act of nature or some other means, then what are we looking at here? What's beneath the surface of all of these other, important questions?\nI wonder if it's so basic and fundamental, that we breeze past it without much thought: What is humanity?\nNot just what is it, but what do we want it to be?\nIs our purpose really to exert dominance over other species and systems that nature has designed to be whole and complete? \nI think the quote from War for the Planet of the Apes reveals our human insecurity that we really are fragile, despite all of our progress, all of our technology, all of our advancement, all of the things that make us human. Despite all of that, we\u2019re still suspicious of the things we create, as though they might rise up against us\u2014dominate us.\nI think we're scared of how vulnerable we really are. There are no guarantees that protect us from tragedy: disease, death, disaster, destruction. Our technology cannot save us from ourselves, nor from calamity. Even if it did, we would still be scared of that very technology, wondering when the curtains could fall and the truth is revealed.\nWe may be even more susceptible to these fears because of our most recent brush with pandemics:\n\n\nThe [COVID-19] pandemic appears to be changing how humans see their place in the world... It has reminded us of Darwin's most profound insight\u2014what has been referred to as &ldquo;the darkest of his truths, well known and persistently forgotten&rdquo;\u2014that humans are just another species of animal and, like everything else in the animal kingdom, we are vulnerable to the threat posed by pathogens. If we Homo sapiens don't strive to live in balance with the other living things on our planet, we face a very bleak future.\n\n\n\u2014Pathogenesis, by Jonathan Kennedy, pg 228\n\n\nCyborg\nThough it may not seem it from my writing here, this exploration has brought me a feeling of deep compassion as well as sadness. When I first wrote about the dangers of AI, especially concerning our cognitive biases almost a year ago, I was angry. I felt deceived by my own brain, taken advantage of by companies, and stuck in an infinite loop of traps.\nThe year since, I've really tried to understand the major systems at play, at least in my country and my particular culture. Anger has been replaced with sadness as I contemplate what we've built and how we perpetuate harm to our own species, let alone others in this vast world.\nBut if we take a look at the Colonel's quote one more time, there's a subtle possibility hidden at the very start:\n&ldquo;Mercy. You have any idea what mercy would do to us?&rdquo; He asks.\nWhile the script goes on with a negative view of the concept of &ldquo;mercy,&rdquo; we have not yet explored the other possibility. What if our humanity could be, &ldquo;mercy&rdquo;? What if that was our distinguishing feature? What if that was the way out of systems that take and take and take with no compassion or balance?\nGeorge Thompson put it beautifully in one of his videos: What if nature were something to belong to, rather than to take from?\nWith all of the systems we have created or to which we are a part, the natural world takes precedence. Maybe the question of our lives is more about how we can integrate with our Mother System, rather than childishly attempting to dominate and stand apart?\nWorks Cited\n(1) Objects Don't Have Desires: Toward an Anthropology of Technology beyond Anthropomorphism, American Anthropologist, Vol. 123, No. 4, pp. 758, 2021, Alf Hornborg.

Our professor had found out about it and asked him to explain what he was doing\u2014little did I know this wasn\u2019t as unique as I thought it was, and it would be something I would end up doing many times.\nThis student was older than most of us; he had already had work experience in the design field and even helped produce an eclectic magazine. Photography was his specialty in the arts and he had set up a blog to document his project: one photo a day for a year.\nIt\u2019s the kind of project that has weight to it. It shows skill and dedication. Most importantly, it creates creativity.\nIt turns out that the \u201cdaily X for Y (time)\u201d project is very common among artists and is even an effective strategy for gaining followers on social media and other methods of internet fame.\nI believe that these daily projects are important for the rest of us, artist or not, especially in the age of AI, based on the findings of two experiments I\u2019ve run this year.\nCreative Blocks\nDaily projects can be extremely difficult because of the creativity required. It\u2019s easy to get burned out or frustrated. That\u2019s not the best situation for something as fragile as creativity to flourish within. At least, that\u2019s how it seems.\nCreativity often feels out of reach: good ideas are hard to come by, motivation ebbs more than it flows, and it seems like performance art most of the time (meaning you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to get until it\u2019s done).\nInktober is a challenge I took on this year. For each day of October I produced a drawing done in pen/ink. This was the first year I actually followed the official prompts\u2014I usually have taken the challenge and pompously ignored the community behind it, opting instead to draw whatever I pleased each day.\nThis year was vastly different in how I felt about the daily challenge at the end. I actually set parameters for the project: I would only draw dinosaur skeletons (attempting to boost my collection for freakyfossils.com) and I would follow the daily word prompt from the Inktober website.\n\n    \n    Inktober prompt: \"snacks\"\n\nThe parameters I set for this year\u2019s Inktober made it significantly easier to pump out drawings every day. I still went through the typical roller coaster: I can\u2019t wait for Inktober; this is fun; I hate Inktober; when will this end?!; that was really fun. The ideas flowed more often despite the emotional ride, thanks to the system set up around it.\nCreating creativity is a practice of system creation: enough rigidity to support the flexibility.\nUnderstanding how creativity works is what the daily project continuously teaches me first. It reminds me that it doesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019m in the mood or even if I have an idea, I still need to produce something. The pressure of a daily project is what creates creativity. The restrictions or parameters of the project help us lean on creativity because it essentially constructs a problem to be solved.\nGiven infinite time and space, we would never create anything substantial. Daily projects force us to do something\u00a0because\u00a0of its tight frame.\nNow that we\u2019re backed into a corner, facing our daily commitment, we have to figure out a way to get it done. Necessity encourages ideas to flow\u2014as long as the pressure is not too great that we instead switch to an anxiety or fear response.\nDaily Tune-ups\nYouTuber, The Bioneer, said something in one of his videos that served as inspiration for my other daily project experiment:\n\n&quot;[Fitness] becomes a genuine form of self-expression and freedom as you learn to craft the body that you want and to use it to achieve the things that you want to achieve.&quot;\n\nWhile we sometimes relate creativity with self-expression, I had never before thought that it could find a venue for that expression in physical movement. This was something I wanted to explore, so I created a daily video project with two goals:\n\nAttempt to revitalize one of my YouTube channels\nTest my creativity in the physical space\n\nThe challenge was to demonstrate what I consider to be \u201cmicro skills\u201d as a daily tune-up for my coordination. Mostly it means, what\u2019s the simplest trick I can do with a tennis ball or a bean bag? How many of these can I figure out? 54 videos later and I still have ideas that I haven\u2019t gotten to.\nHow is that even possible? It\u2019s the most ridiculous, simple idea, how is it that there is still more to do?\nThe physical creativity surprised me. It\u2019s way more common to expect creativity to come in forms of knowledge work: writing, drawing, brainstorming, coding\u2026but creative object manipulation isn\u2019t what first comes to my mind.\nThere was one unique emphasis about this challenge: play. There\u2019s no getting around it: put a bean bag or a tennis ball in my hand and I\u2019m going to be popping, dribbling, juggling, bouncing, throwing, and rolling it.\u00a0This daily challenge is just fun for me\u2014it\u2019s an 80% play with 20% work (video editing) kind of project.\nWith so much play and fun, the creativity is so much easier to access. In fact, I even looked forward to filming a trick for the next day, so I\u2019d often come up with ideas in anticipation. Other times when I pulled out the tripod, having no ideas at all, I would mess around until I realized there was a movement or a trick I hadn\u2019t done before.\nPlay is such a crucial aspect of creativity because it frees you from judging yourself or your ideas too early. It allows you to break barriers or act in ways that aren\u2019t typical.\nSum of Parts\nThe compound effect is often talked about in the financial world\u2014small and consistent investments over time that eventually yield larger returns than just the sum of what was invested. Daily projects seem to work in a similar way.\nSkills are developed using this method. It\u2019s essentially a practice routine that bundles pressure, challenge, and interest into a consistent flow. The secret to getting good or gaining experience is putting in the time to do that thing, so the daily project is a secret to making sure it gets done.\nI had no idea how impactful daily challenges and projects would be in my life when I first encountered them from my peer in college. Before we get to the final benefits, there are some setbacks that need to be addressed first:\n\nDailies are going to be hit and miss. There are Inktober drawings that I am extremely embarrassed to have drawn and then posted publicly, because I was too tired that day or the rendering was just terrible.\nThe projects eventually end for me. The longest daily project I ever did was doing push-ups everyday for four or five years. It ended in a shoulder injury and I never picked it back up.\n\nTo address these two setbacks, I think it\u2019s important to approach dailies with the right mindset: It\u2019s ok to be human\u00a0and\u00a0try to be consistent. Don\u2019t attach your identity to the outcome of these projects (a mistake I have made almost every time until recently).\nJust because you won\u2019t always be pleased with the result or product of the day, doesn\u2019t mean it was a wasted effort. Going back to the compound effect, not only do these hit-and-misses help you develop skills, I also think that the collective body of work is more interesting than the single piece separated.\nEven in terms of physical daily challenges like my daily tune-ups, I think the entire playlist of these 30 second videos is more valuable than any one video on its own. (Even commenters have struggled to understand what I\u2019m doing, lol.)\nThe daily tune-ups are no longer daily\u2014I had a solid streak for many weeks, but since it overlapped with Inktober and it got cold in the mornings when I have time for filming, the videos have much more time between them. This taught me a final principle: the harder or more work the daily project, the shorter the time frame should be. The easier it is to produce, the longer you can go.\nIt\u2019s so much easier to do something hard every day for 30 days than to think that it will go on for years. In my experience, it\u2019s actually good to experiment with dailies and their window of time to be done within.\nIn an age where AI is more and more a part of our work, entertainment, and other aspects of digital life, I think that daily projects could be a vital practice in re-engaging in our own lives and skills.\nIt\u2019s hard work, no doubt. Looking back after a tough challenge, however, is usually spectacular.\nI still work to obtain, practice, and refine skills even though there are always people who are better than me in every possible way. AI is just another addition to the pool of talent that exceeds my own.\nI do dailies just for me.

Part of this is, admittedly, my innate desire to go against the crowd, but I also think that a lot of the ways people tend to approach January is flawed.\nTiming matters\u2014we have rich psychological experiences with timing, such as the beginning and the ending of projects, relationships, and life itself. (If you want an excellent and engaging book about all of that, consider When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing by Dan Pink).\nIt makes perfect sense to start the new year with fresh goals and renewed resolve to accomplish what we didn\u2019t last year. However, that\u2019s exactly the problem: we too often want to somehow \u201ccatch up\u201d on everything we wanted to do last year and the year before. I just think that the time scale of an entire year is way too long for most people to successfully plan for.\nRather than one big, start-of-the-year plan, I like to check in with myself many times throughout the year. Discarding goals that have lost interest or relevance, tweaking my current patterns of behavior, and adding new challenges that are shorter-term have been my most successful practices.\nI also realize there\u2019s still a magical feeling that comes from that fresh January, so if you\u2019re still adamant at following the collective ritual of new year resolutions, here are my top three tips I\u2019ve discovered this year to help with personal knowledge management (PKM) work. Hopefully with this quick check-in, we can get ready to meet the new year with better systems to carry us further than we would just winging it (like I\u2019m prone to do).\nPKM might be one of the most impactful practices we can have now that we\u2019ve entered the age of AI. I am convinced it has far-reaching benefits from work to skill development and even the fun, personal projects that we do.\n1. Save previously solved problems\nThere\u2019s nothing I hate more than coming back to something that I\u2019ve done before, but that\u2019s complex and unfamiliar. For example, renewing SSL certificates on my websites or managing a subscription or even folding up a tent or canopy so that it fits back into the original bag.\nIt\u2019s the stuff that you have to do infrequently, so you don\u2019t remember the specifics, but that has a system or set of steps that makes things super easy provided you figure it out!\nFor these cases, I highly recommend jotting down the steps in your note system. This year, when I\u2019m setting up something new, I\u2019ll crack open Obsidian and drop really quick keywords and screenshots as I\u2019m working through something. When I\u2019m done, I\u2019ll clean it up just a bit and make sure I have enough in the title or the note to be able to find it again.\nIt has saved me so many times when I go back to do that same thing 5 months later. URLs, hints, or steps all right there waiting for me. And if I missed something, or if something changed I can just update it right then when I\u2019m doing it.\nWork processes are where this has been especially useful\u2014quickly getting back on the same page with old projects, finding resources that are always buried in Slack messages, and helping me keep everything I need at my disposal. No AI needed ;)\n2. Productivity isn't everything\nI recently came across an argument that has rattled my analytical mindset. Normally, I try to determine the value of some thing or activity based on its effectiveness or how it relates to my productivity. That even includes trying to rationalize the benefits of physical exercise or juggling or any of the other random things I do for fun.\nThe challenge to this was a question of the worth of seemingly unprofitable activities. Why read fantasy? It won\u2019t make you any money. Why learn traditional martial arts when so much of it \u201cdoesn\u2019t work\u201d (says the keyboard warrior in the comments, anyway)?\nWhat I\u2019m realizing is that not everything is directly tied to economic productivity\u2014and that doesn\u2019t mean it has no worth!\nWhen it comes to PKM, it can seem like extra work at times. Maybe it isn\u2019t magically making me more productive or creative. And yet it is something I enjoy. I love exploring topics, I love capturing ideas, and I love reading old notes or thoughts on the random things I\u2019ve written about.\nPKM can absolutely help with productivity, but productivity isn\u2019t the most valuable goal to me anymore. Working towards peak productivity has left me feeling empty, like I fell short of something. Instead, working towards better thinking, more clarity in my writing, and more exploration in topics and conclusions has become much more rewarding.\n3. Don't get trapped in settings\nFormatting, naming, and setting things up is a completely different state of mind than actually creating.\nI\u2019ve seen a pattern in me\u2014especially with my design background\u2014in which I want things to be aesthetically pleasing and typographically ideal when I\u2019m working on things. However, it really is a trap to do this too early.\nEvery time I start with changing font sizes or fiddling with colors, it\u2019s just procrastination pretending to be creativity. Instead, I like to start in my notes (Obsidian) because I don\u2019t have controls over much of the formatting.\nI almost always throw in a \u201cScratch\u201d section in my CYBORG_ articles. This is where I dump ideas or bullet points that I might use in the newsletter. It helps me get over the scary blank page and blinking cursor. Having a plain text, minimal setup for your workspace can be extremely helpful in focusing on the right things first: creation\u00a0then\u00a0formatting.\nCyborg\nApproaching the upcoming year with a few tips and some pre-planning will hopefully set you up for better success. If there\u2019s anything else I\u2019ve learned this year, it\u2019s that I need to treat myself with more compassion and understanding.\nWe fail, make mistakes\u2014it\u2019s inevitable. Maybe the trope of new year resolutions only lasting to February (if you\u2019re really lucky) is a chance for us to collectively remember that we all fail sometimes.

Even just the \u201cmentions\u201d charts for the terms in Google seem to line up perfectly with my personal experience hearing the words in both media and normal social communication:\n\n    \n    Source: Google, accessed 10-14-2024\n\n\n    \n    Source: Google, accessed 10-14-2024\n\nDespite how these words have entered into our lexicon, I don\u2019t think we have grasped what these practices are really for and what they can do. Not to say that I have it figured out, but I wonder if these skills will be critical to human flourishing alongside technology. It certainly seems so in the future as I imagine it.\nOne of the most important things to know about meditation is that it\u2019s not about perfection. It\u2019s not the complete domination of mind so that you turn off all thoughts and go into a mythical monk state.\nMeditation is about\u00a0attention redirection.\nPerhaps it\u2019s all we have left to fight with if companies continue to pursue \u201cthe bottom of the brain stem\u201d with engagement algorithms and psychology-hacking techniques.\nAttention is our OP tool, because when we are directing (or redirecting) our attention towards our craft, our work, or our creative pursuits, we make monumental progress. \u201cPutting our mind to it\u201d may well be a phrase moving out of the clich\u00e9 and into wisdom as we learn how to coexist with technology that attempts to deactivate the mind.\nFocus and attention have always made the difference in whatever humans have pursued. It is not a commodity nor an infinite resource. It can\u2019t be multiplied or scaled. Instead, we must treat it with greater respect and reverence.\nAttention is a Currency\nSince the advent of social media\u2014and especially, the algorithmic incentivization of engagement and retention\u2014a new currency has joined the market: attention. It has probably always been part of the market, but it\u2019s never been more potent and easily accessible, in my opinion, especially to small businesses and creators.\nThe social media game has three players: The company, the consumers, and the creators. The company owning the social media platform (e.g. Facebook) must gain and retain as much attention as possible to scale profits through advertising. The users of the platform either exchange their attention for dopamine rewards or create content that gains and retains attention, which is rewarded with a small cut of the advertising fee paid to the social media company.\nNever before has the phrase \u201cpay attention\u201d been more literal. The things we direct our attention to are now actual economic exchanges. This means that even our passive scrolling on social media is a monetary payment to the platform through the ads it shows in the brief interaction we\u2019ve had.\nThe odd part of this is that the economic exchange is not symmetrical. The social media company receives money, but what was paid was arguably more costly.\nIf our attention is a scarce resource, when we divert it from a productive or purposeful venue to a cheap entertainment venue, we aren\u2019t just losing the time, but also the value of our attention. More value has been collected by a third-party, and less value is left for our own benefit.\nI see this when I get sucked into a Reels-binging session on Instagram and then try to get back to work. It\u2019s often very disorienting to switch to a more cognitively intense task. But I wonder if there is an ancient solution to this modern problem?\nNot even Instagram Reels and other short-form content can keep up with the speed of thoughts that swirl in my head at times. If the problem isn\u2019t so much about the amount of information in front of me but whether I can redirect my attention to what matters, then it sounds an awful lot like the experience of meditation.\nAs we meditate, we will have thoughts. Our arm might go numb or our face will get itchy. We will get distracted. That\u2019s not a failure.\nWe will use social media. We will get trapped in a scrolling session watching adorable cat videos. That\u2019s not a failure.\nInstead, we are being intentional with our actions. We make the choice to engage, and then, perhaps, we train ourselves to be able to exit the engagement on our own terms. It\u2019s the escape from these attention hacking places that matters.\nPresence\nStaying embodied\u2014feeling my feelings, especially the negative and uncomfortable ones\u2014is very difficult for me. I would prefer to only feel good feelings and entirely numb the rest of the angry, sad, and hurt feelings.\nIn a similar way, the design of short-form content feeds gives us the illusion of staying in the good-feeling state, mostly by taking us out of an embodied experience. It\u2019s a distraction. Our attention is no longer in the present. It\u2019s as if it\u2019s suspended in something else.\nMeditation is supposed to be a way to train our attention. It creates the skills to be able to continuously redirect our attention back to our goal or focus. Can it help us solve our technological conundrum? Can we use the same techniques we learn in meditation to intentionally direct and redirect our attention when something else is desperately vying to be in control?

At least in the realm of marketing (my field of work), there is no question that emotion is a greater driver of action than anything else. In fact, I would posit that even when marketing real numbers and data to people, all that is really being communicated is some kind of safety. When did a prospect ever sit down, pull out a spreadsheet and compare the supposed data for productivity of one app vs. another app?\nIt seems like data is often used to comfort us when it agrees with our strategy and it is dismissed when it is in conflict with our strategy. Ultimately, it's a really easy trap to fall right back in with confirmation bias, rather than steering us away from it like it would seem prone to do.\nWhile mustering the courage to push past biases and let the data stand is a valiant topic on its own, I am seeing a different part of the problem right now.\nStacked Against You\nNumbers don't mean anything until they actually impact you, personally. For example, in the U.S., only about three people in 1,000 develop Multiple Sclerosis but that number only means something if you know someone with MS or have it yourself. What seems like safety in such steep numbers can suddenly feel suffocating when you end up in the tiny, affected group. How could it happen to me, of all the possible people?\nIt's a bizarre thing to find where you intersect in statistics like this for various things: how likely is it that you are a certain gender, ethnicity, have XYZ expertise, and hosts of other things (it's not all bad stuff like diseases). \nThe problem is that at a certain point, numbers are still meaningless because, in our world, we've started to understand people and systems in terms of numbers that our brains just can't fathom. What does it mean to have 1 million followers on a social media account? How can there be 1.5(ish) billion people just in India? I can't even comprehend that 48,000 people have watched me tell the story of the worst weekend of my life (my MS attack).\nWhen I think about the systems at play in our world, it's the most overwhelming thing I can do. People\u2014real people\u2014all with individual lives and experiences interacting with other people. Sometimes harming others, sometimes helping, sometimes ignoring. \nAs I have contemplated the trauma and harm being deployed at the whims of political agendas (especially as the U.S. has a new president), I've felt so pathetically small. So powerless. So dismissed. What could I possibly do when the numbers are stacked against me?\nA Different Drive\nConsulting with my therapist, we realized together that this overwhelm isn't really just because of the content I'm consuming. It's a system that is draining because it impacts and affects all of us. The fear and stress introduced with executive orders intent on causing pain and suffering to marginalized groups impacts all of us\u2014even if we're not part of those groups ourselves.\nThis is actually somewhat intuitive: if someone hurts a family member or a close friend, you feel hurt, too. That's empathy and connection. We're social creatures, after all. But it is more than that.\n&quot;Every bit of pain that our community experiences ripples through everyone that cares.&quot; Dr. Lisa Diamond said as she explained a study done in Utah, U.S.A. last year during a legislative session. (See the full presentation, it's exceptionally insightful). She took a look at those connected to the LGBTQ community, grouped by queer individuals and those who love them (allies, friends, family who aren't queer).\nOne of the key findings after looking at how people responded to the legislative sessions was that cisgender, heterosexual family members (those who would not be directly affected by the legislation) reported worse mental health than they had before the session. In fact, that group had the greatest change out of the sample groups. As Dr. Diamond summarized on her slide during the presentation:\n&quot;This shows that the toll of an increasingly anti-LGBTQ climate extends far beyond the LGBTQ population.&quot;\nI extrapolate this to all anti-humanity policies including but not limited to: discrimination, persecution, erasure, silencing of voices and opinions, inaccessibility, racism, sexism, transphobia, homophobia, xenophobia. When we hurt even the smallest demographic among us, it eventually leaks out to hurting all of us.\nThere may be difficult decisions that have to be made to uphold long-tested and established laws, but doing so in a rushed, sloppy manner without due process or without respecting human dignity is the greater crime.\nSocial safety, as Dr. Diamond explains, is fundamental to a human's well-being, mentally, physically, and emotionally. It does not mean agreement. It does not even mean understanding what someone's experience is like. Social safety is when you take a stand and show someone that when they are hurt, you are hurt. When someone wants to harm them, you will be there to protect them. When ideologies or policies dismiss your concerns, welfare, or existence, social safety says &quot;I see you, I feel it, I'm here with you.&quot;\nCyborg\nBeing data-driven can be a positive, productive strategy. But when faced with staggering numbers or odds that seem impossible to surmount, there\u2019s another strategy.\nLeading a value-driven life is perhaps more sustainable over time, more fulfilling, and has the potential to make impact. Values are what we are made of deep down\u2014the things most important and precious to us; the things we want to cultivate, protect, and see expressed in our lives.\nI believe that the dignity of humanity is one of my values, and I\u2019ve got a hunch it\u2019s one of yours if you\u2019ve stuck with this newsletter. We don\u2019t have to see eye to eye on specific issues. We don\u2019t have to agree.\nWe do have to treat each other with respect. We do have to see each other and everyone else as humans: equal and precious.\nA final thought from Dr. Diamond\u2019s presentation is that as we observe how people are affected by policies or events or oppression, we can either become a source of safety for them, or remove ourselves as a source of safety. For those who reported gaining a source of safety, her study saw a correlated increase in mental health and a decrease in hyper-vigilance.\nShe said that the group that most likely felt the greatest impact and transformation was the group that went from zero sources of social safety to one source. Zero to one is something you can do. There is someone in your life that you can affect in a profound way. No need to try and sway thousands or millions. Instead, turn to the edges of your social network and see if you can be the life-altering source of safety for someone who feels utterly alone and vulnerable.\nWhen we protect the smallest, the weakest, it means we are helping the big numbers of us, too.

Cultivating better tech habits. \u00b6 \u201cMy image didn\u2019t upload\u2026what\u2019s the size limit for the website?\u201d A new coworker asked me. She was trying to upload an image that was 2 megabytes large for a spot on the website that was only 600px x 400px.\nI know it\u2019s probably not apparent to most people how absurd that is, but it is literally ridiculous. (If you want to know more about image sizing, check out my \u200bultimate guide to images on the web\u200b).\nLarge images are the most common way to slow down website load times, meaning it takes forever to actually use the site you're trying to access. It's also a huge waste of resources, storage space, and energy.\nThe problem here isn\u2019t the non-technical coworker trying to upload an exorbitantly large image\u2014it\u2019s actually the system we\u2019re all a part of. I\u2019m not sure what caused this problem\u2014social media, cultural values\u2014but I think it\u2019s an issue that has deep roots and does need attention.\nShortcuts\nMany designers have become dependent on shortcuts because often they\u2019re under so much pressure to pump out images that they skip over exporting them correctly.\nIn the world of print, it is much more devastating to choose incorrect settings and exported images. Usually more care is taken to emphasize quality and do things correctly the first time\u2014we don\u2019t want to end up throwing away 500 posters because of one mistake, after all.\nHowever in the digital world, the consequences of mistakes or poorly exported images feel trivial. Things like spelling errors can be corrected without rebuilding the entire website from scratch. If a huge image is uploaded and only ever rendered at half of its size, who cares?\nAt the speed the world seems to be moving, there\u2019s seemingly little incentive to understand the technology you\u2019re using. Developers have made a good faith effort to make things accessible, especially for allowing non-technical people to publish content online.\nUnfortunately, that also means hiding fundamental processes. For example, if you upload a huge image to social media, they process it for you behind the scenes\u2014no way they're taking that 2mb picture and leaving it at that size. That abstraction trains lay people and professionals alike to assume they can just put anything they want anywhere they want. But it still is a massive waste that can be avoided if only through a little bit of understanding.\nWe are much more comfortable with the ever-growing amount of digital sawdust thanks to things like unlimited storage or technological na\u00efvet\u00e9. In fact, we even get messages from tech companies, like this Apple iPhone commercial, where the whole story revolves around not deleting any of your images:\n\n    \niPhone Storage Magic\n\nDespite all of the bad takes and the photos that are effectively duplicates of each other, don't bother pruning your phone's photo gallery. No, no, no. Don't even delete anything anymore.\nAs systems-thinker, Vicky Zhao, says, &quot;This is one of the key reasons why we, as a society, think so short term. We're over-indexing on what needs to come in, but we're not thinking about once it's in, what do we do with it?&quot; \nCheck-in\nI\u2019m as guilty as anyone in my digital storage habits. I have projects from 15 years ago, stored on various, disorganized drives and cloud storage subscriptions. I also create things constantly: scripts, notes, rough drafts of CYBORG_, thumbnails, images, animations, and lots and lots of website code.\nAs a creative, I hold onto things that might \u201cbenefit\u201d me somehow in the future. It\u2019s baked into the nature of the fields I\u2019m in: portfolios show your work; personal projects are fulfilling; and sifting through really old, terrible files is very satisfying because I can see actual progress in my skill development.\nThe problem isn\u2019t necessarily about rigorous practices of deleting files\u2014though that can be a part of healthy digital habits going forward. It\u2019s how technology, by design, is causing a decay. Just like landfills full of trash, we are collecting, gathering, and shoveling digital garbage into our lives. How are you supposed to tame something so vast and self-propagating?\nCYBORG\nScalability is the nature of digital technology: increasing, compounding. Humanity is often retained or rediscovered in stillness, slowing down, cutting back.\nThese two critical features of our lives are on opposite courses, so where is the balance? I think there are a few options for us:\n\nBecome friends with the delete button.\nFocus on quality.\n\nThese two options actually support each other. In order to commit to deleting something, I try to assume the role of an art director. Scrutinizing my videos and photos for things to cut. Being able to delete or reduce comes from the focus on quality. When I\u2019m honest with myself, I can lean on the skills I have to determine if something actually has value or if it\u2019s just in the middle (sort of good, sort of not).\nIt\u2019s not just about deleting, though. Being the art director of my digital spaces, I\u2019m starting to also thin out the incoming streams of things like downloads, content, and copies.\nI latched onto a mantra over 7 years ago: Do more with what you have. This was in contrast to the idiotic, clich\u00e9 messaging that executives love to tell employees: Do more with less. However, in this context, the idea of doing more with what you have is not only a stand against greedy executives trying to squeeze out everything from you with no benefit to you. It\u2019s also a stand against the system that optimizes for dopamine rewards in the constant seeking of more novelty, less quality.\nNot more. Better. Tags: "}, {"title": "The Problem with Summaries", "category": "Newsletters", "href": "/newsletters/the-problem-with-summaries/", "body": "Is artificial intelligence actually helping us by summarizing everything? \u00b6 Last week I mentioned reading\u00a0Pathogenesis\u00a0by Jonathan Kennedy. When I listened to the conclusion I was changed. It was a captivating book, sure, but the way it concluded took all of this work we had done together\u2014the author reading in my ear, and me listening\u2014and brought it straight home and into my reality.\nFinishing this book reminded me how dangerous the AI we currently have could be.\nInnocuous\nI have done more serious reading since leaving school, so perhaps this is some mundane thing to you, but for me, I\u2019ve been stunned at how reading has affected me.\nIn school, I proudly paraded the fact that I almost\u00a0never\u00a0read an assigned book from at least middle school through college, but could tout the highest marks in my English and literature classes.\nIt wasn't necessarily because I was obstinate or lazy. My reluctance to read what was assigned was largely because I\u2019m an exceptionally slow reader. I don\u2019t think I could\u2019ve ever actually finished my reading even if I was especially studious and disciplined.\nOne time in an advanced English class, I decided I really did want to try and read the book,\u00a0A River Runs Through It. Unfortunately for me, the book I checked out had two or three other stories by the author, starting with one that I spent all my time reading, only to find out a day or so before the test that it was absolutely\u00a0not\u00a0the right story. So, in desperation I leaned on the thing that had helped me out of all of the unfinished or unread books before: my writing skills and a SparkNotes summary.\nAfter the test I got a comment on my essay: \u201cWow! I can tell you read the book.\u201d\nFeel free to judge me for my insolence and deceit. My only real regret is that I couldn\u2019t be in the space to truly embody the things that I was being taught. The classroom always supplemented the book with discussions and ideas. It's not like I didn't learn anything from the book\u2014it's just that it was second-hand and I missed out on\u00a0experiencing\u00a0the story.\nI also don\u2019t regret my actions, because I was playing a game. After all, I wasn\u2019t technically cheating, because I still had to come up with the ideas I wrote about (at least at the time, SparkNotes didn\u2019t give me much help besides a summary of the plot).\nThis game was set up by the institutions that should have been educating me, but instead, were challenging me to accumulate the most with the least effort. I was in it for the grades, not the development. It wasn\u2019t time for that, and no amount of systems or tricks or instructional designs would\u2019ve made a difference.\nI\u2019m in a\u00a0much\u00a0different place now. I also have access to technology (specifically audiobooks on my phone) that have made it possible for a slow-reading, obstinate, stick-in-the-mud like myself to actually derive value from dense, eclectic, or important books.\nImagine what I could\u2019ve done with an AI chatbot that summarized everything for me in real time?\nFalse Floor\nAs I wrapped up my audiobook this weekend, I felt different. I had been on a journey with Kennedy as we explored the impact of catastrophic plagues and pathogens on human history. My understanding of life has simultaneously become more deep and more murky. I have questions. I have incentive to pursue those questions, none of which will be satisfied with a Google search or lazy perusal of a few pieces of content.\nI could have saved a lot of time by simply getting the summary of the book from ChatGPT. But that\u2019s the trap.\nSo much of the current usage of generative AI is for summarizing texts, books, and other media. Maybe it\u2019s helpful 20% of the time (and I\u2019m being generous, here), but no one ever changed their life after reading a summary.\nStories are what change us.\nNo amount of summarization can compensate for the slow realization over the course of a book that everything I used to think needs to be reconsidered.\nFor change to happen, we have to put in work over time. It\u2019s hard and slow, and we leave that process with meaning, purpose, and fulfillment. Without our involvement when the transformation opportunity appears, we\u2019re stuck where we are.\nCyborg\nI realize that I wasted much of my education gaming the system. However, I did learn a lot along the way. What really happened was I robbed myself of the opportunity to advance\u00a0through\u00a0my education.\nAI isn\u2019t inherently bad\u2014it\u2019s not good either. It\u2019s yet another choice presented to us to either engage or disengage in our own personal transformation.\nIt may seem dramatic to call something like the choice to summarize or to read as a \u201ctransformation opportunity.\u201d It absolutely\u00a0is\u00a0overly dramatic on the individual instance. The collective debt that adds up over time is where this becomes concerning. Like everything, there is nuance, intention, and wisdom that must be applied\u2014and\u00a0you\u00a0must apply it.\nMy warning here is based on my less technologically sophisticated experience short-changing my education. I got the grades, good for me. But, for what, really? Neither of my fields of study give any credence to the actual grades I received. Arguably, I could have gotten exactly where I am now without even going to college (I do recognize my privilege weighs in here, too).\nAn AI assistant\u00a0can\u00a0help you in those tight spaces where you\u2019re against the wall and have to come up with something now. It can also become a crutch that hampers your ability to move beyond. Even more dangerous is the potential decay and attrition that relying on AI may cause. It seems innocuous to summarize our current task in a project management software or summarize a book so we don\u2019t have to bother with it. But what is the cost of using our mind more and more for seeking ease, and less and less for encountering challenge?\nUltimately, I love how my friend put it in a conversation just yesterday. Technology is a gift, a blessing, but we have to choose where it will be activated in our lives. What skills do I want to own for myself? Which can be delegated? Approaching technology with serious intention, rather than offering yourself to it to be possessed by it is the distinguishing factor.\nThere\u2019s always a chance you\u2019ll come back when you\u2019re ready; when it\u2019s the right time. Not every book is worth reading. You may need a summary to know if it\u00a0might\u00a0be worth reading. Summarize all you want, but everything has a cost, and it may be worth paying as long as you know that you\u2019re paying it. Tags: "}, {"title": "Someone You Can Build a Nest In", "category": "Newsletters", "href": "/newsletters/someone-you-can-build-a-nest-in/", "body": "Humans and monsters have a lot more in common than you might think. Explore what monstrosity does or can do for humanity even in the age of technology. \u00b6 Surrounded by science and technology, with very few frontiers left to penetrate, it's an odd thing for a 21st century society to continue to lean on monster stories. From movies to games, it's become a vast industry of entertainment to explore what we know are mere figments of our imaginations\u2014or at least, artifacts of our cognition. Monsters aren't real, but they are still among us.\nFear of the unknown becomes encapsulated in the bodies and behaviors of monsters. Any decent horror film exploits the deep, ancient parts of our brains to cause even the most hearty and posturing human to feel something. A tingle on the spine, a falling sensation in the chest, or a subtle feeling of dread teasing your mind.\nMonster stories spoke to me as a kid in a way that other stories did not initially. I was a closeted queer kid without any concept of why or how I was different than my peers, yet I still knew that I was. I felt like a monster from stories I'd read or even ones I'd created: Something different, something others feared, despite being benevolent\u2014the good guy. Being misunderstood and misrepresented makes it easy to relate to the creatures we've invented since the beginning of our humanity. And the worst part is that we usually make monsters out of humans.\nMonstrous\nI just finished a delightful, queer monster book by John Wiswell, Someone You Can Build a Nest In. It has everything my inner child craves in a monster story: action, conflict, dark humor, secrets, and companionship. It is possibly my all-time favorite. I can't recommend it enough\u2014no matter your orientation or identity.\nWe're dropped instantly into a dangerous situation for our protagonist, Shesheshen, an amorphous creature who can absorb items (usually body parts, but other things, too) to help her shapeshift to take the form she needs. She often re-works the things she has swallowed to construct a form that passes as human. \nImmediately, this monster reflects the queer experience of &quot;passing as straight,&quot; which is how we often describe ourselves when we're closeted. Keeping up appearances that make it seem like you belong, that your experience of the world is the same as all of the straight / cisgender people around you. Even though in Wiswell's world, being queer is not really seen as out of the ordinary or monstrous (as it certainly is in the real world), Shesheshen reflects the stress of hiding in plain sight as she flees from monster hunters into a nearby town, trying to blend in with the locals.\nSecrets, lying, and pretending may not be monstrous behaviors in themselves, but from experience I know that the weight of these things are harmful over time. It's part of the minority stress that I experienced as an outcast, even though it was never overt (I was lucky to never be accused of being gay or made fun of for my gender non-conformity in appearance as a kid). I, like Shesheshen, found myself in dangerous circumstances in public. I didn't have to be the target of bullying or rage to know that I could easily become the target if I did not wear my mask well.\nAs Shesheshen works to hide as a human, she observes that this town has already started celebrating in anticipation that the monster hunters who were sent into her lair had succeeded in slaying her. She notes:\n\nThese emotions she didn't know how to carry. There was the insult of having her death celebrated when she wasn't even dead. When she was, in fact, amidst them all right now, and only out here because they'd sent killers to fail in her home. But this. To be dying from the poison of those assassins, and while looking for emergency food to survive the injury, to be told by a drunk rich boy with inconvenient hair that she had never really existed. Now their songs made unkind sense to her. This reverie was a kind of fear, for hatred was the fear people let themselves enjoy.\n\nPart 1, Chapter 3, transcribed from the audio book (punctuation is my best guess).\nWe, here in the twenty-first century, have an effective strategy for getting rid of monsters: make them non-existent. To wipe away identity is a very effective means of violence without getting any gore on your hands! We've seen this as trans people have been persecuted in the U.S. by removing any acknowledgement of their identity on passports, IDs, and other legal documents. Oh, you're trans or intersex? Sorry, you have to fit into either M or F on this form\u2014and it better match the arbitrary M or F that someone decided fit you best at birth.\nOf course, this tactic isn't actually new. Other communities have been devastated this way for thousands of years. Indigenous people all throughout the world have suffered this erasure of identity. Ancient cultures and languages have been punished into secrecy or out of existence by invaders and colonizers. What great losses have we inflicted upon each other as the drive to eradicate, conquer, and assimilate have been implemented throughout history?\nThe Conflict\nThe title of the book haunted the entire story. While our heroic shapeshifter falls in love with a human despite all the dangers that it poses to Shesheshen's own life, there's still the uncomfortable &quot;truth&quot; that accompanies her monstrous nature: For Shesheshen, to love someone means to build a nest in that person\u2014the body becoming a source of food for the offspring to devour and disintegrate entirely. A disturbing likeness to parasitic insects that can inject their eggs through a stinger into another host that is often eaten alive from inside out.\nHow can I love this main character, as I am so prone to do, having followed her journey and empathized with her so long, knowing that the outcome will be the utter, painful destruction of her love? I listened with rapt attention throughout the book, dreading the final conflict when everything is exposed; when both characters fully understand one another. How can I love a character like that?\nThe question gives me pause now, because I know it's a question all of my family and friends have had to grapple with once they know and see me as I am. How can they love a person like me?\nMaybe that seems harsh\u2014maybe you're upset that I might think that you would think that. Yet, I know well that we often think thoughts and feel feelings that we do not want. We all make mistakes, for sure, but we also fail to be perfectly whole and consistent in the way that our perception of ourselves pretends that we are. We can have thoughts that horrify us, like a mother thinking that she might not be able to love her queer child, then regretting the thought, disgusted with herself.\nI think when we encounter disgust in a moral conflict\u2014like whether you can love a queer family member or friend\u2014it is an opportunity to reflect more deeply, rather than a sign that you are unequivocally right. Like my therapist told me, &quot;Thoughts are not facts.&quot; We still have to deal with them, however, and explore why we might be having these thoughts or feelings. Is there a system that has inserted its own ideas or values into yours? Do those ideas and values serve you? \nDisgust is seemingly an integral part of our experience with humanity and monstrosity. It is summed up well in the book, On Monsters, by Stephen T. Asma, page 184:\n\nThe philosopher of horror Noel Carroll...arrived at his own mismatch theory by noticing that most horror monsters are disgusting as well as threatening. He argues that human beings seem especially disgusted by &quot;impurity.&quot; Things that we find impure and consider to be abominations are usually interstitial entities, in between normal categories of being.\n\nTo be queer is to be in-between. Even the word queer carries the baggage of &quot;appearing, feeling, or behaving otherwise than is usual or normal.&quot; It is very easy to demonize a smaller group of people\u2014especially those you don't know personally\u2014and exploit our intuitive sense of disgust by pointing it towards those people you want to exclude, dominate, or destroy. We've been doing this...always.\nDisgust can be helpful for us in identifying danger\u2014such as encountering...things...that could carry disease. We know there is danger to be found even among our own social circles: emotional and social dangers that are every bit as real and harmful as physical dangers. So perhaps disgust is an attempt to help us sort through the possible dangers that we face. Sometimes it also promotes pro-social behavior, like refusing to take part in a system or a policy or a company that harms vulnerable people for profit or power.\nThe problem with ascribing monstrosity onto a population of humans, wholesale, is that the perspective of human vs. monster is completely relative. Throughout U.S. history (that which I'm most familiar), the LGBTQ+ community has been called demonic by churches, criminals by law-makers, and mentally-disordered by psychologists. Monsters, indeed. But as more time, experience, advocacy, and information has been collected, allies find themselves in the uncomfortable space, knowing that they may have at one time thought of the people they love as monsters, when the real monstrosity was that deception\u2014the removal of humanity from other humans.\nDemonization of people is not a mere thought-experiment or innocent theological argument. It has measured, harmful impacts.\n\nIn a society like ours where homosexuals are uniformly treated with disparagement or contempt\u2014to say nothing about outright hostility\u2014it would be surprising indeed if substantial numbers of them did\u00a0not\u00a0suffer from an impaired self-image and some degree of unhappiness with their stigmatized status. \u2026 It is manifestly unwarranted and inaccurate, however, to attribute such neuroticism, when it exists, to intrinsic aspects of homosexuality itself. (p. 400)\n\n\u2014Homosexual Behavior: A Modern Reappraisal (1980), Judd Marmor, as quoted in the Abstract of Prejudice, Social Stress, and Mental Health in Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Populations: Conceptual Issues and Research Evidence\nThe Way Out\nMonsters are alive and well in our minds\u2014that may not be something we can evolve out of for thousands or even millions of years more. Trying to outrun our monsters may be as effective as running from our own shadow. Pretending something (or someone) isn't there is also a poor choice in strategy\u2014and may even end up harming us in the ripples caused by our social violence.\nInstead, we can take our modern-day approach further. The goal isn't to erase the existence of these &quot;monsters,&quot; but to examine them more deeply. If the fear of the unknown is ultimately what a monster is, then we ought to learn more about what we don't know. Dehumanizing someone makes it impossible for us to access our empathy, and in a way, we stray from our own humanity at the same time.\n\n&quot;...we must see the battle\u2014at least for a moment\u2014from the deck of the enemy warship,  because each person has his own perspective, his own reality, no matter how much it may differ from ours.&quot;\n\n\u2014The Gift of Fear, pg 109, Gavin De Becker\nMonsters also provide us an opportunity for self-reflection. We can all relate to monsters in some way, because we've all made choices in the murky waters of ethical and moral conundrums that have harmed others, ourselves, or were simply wrong. We are all a part of systems that are bigger than us that perpetrate horrors on people that we don't usually see up close.\nJust like they reiterated many times in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, we have to always be questioning, &quot;who is the real enemy?&quot; When it comes to humans, our intuition can be deceiving, and outside of immediate danger (please still trust your gut and stay safe) I would suggest that we use the time that we have in safety to remain curious and open-minded. \nIf our world seems teeming with more monsters than it has in the past, why might that be the case? Are we being manipulated to see more monsters among friends? Could we be wrong about the monsters we've been taught to hate? What needs are in question\u2014are my needs not being met, or are my &quot;enemy's&quot; needs not being met? Is there space for us to both exist as we are?\nI think the ultimate lesson from Someone You Can Build a Nest In is perfectly captured by this review of the book from The Guardian:\n\n\u201cThis\u00a0unusual queer romance is a heartfelt fable\u00a0about disability and the possibility of reconciling conflicting needs through love and understanding.\u201d\n Tags: Humanity, Monstrosity, LGBTQIA+"}, {"title": "Ugly Scribbles", "category": "Newsletters", "href": "/newsletters/ugly-scribbles/", "body": "How rough or ugly sketches help us stay in a creative, collaborative, and exploratory mindset. \u00b6 What am I supposed to do with these awful scribbles?\u00a0My mind mumbled as I finished my first assignment in my first drawing class at university. I was doing \u201cblind contour\u201d drawing, which is an exercise in which you look at an object and draw its outline (its contour). The catch is that you can\u2019t pick up your pen and you can\u2019t look down at the paper until you\u2019re done (hence the \u201cblind\u201d).\nI was an art student so that I could get \u201cgood\u201d at drawing, which, at the time, meant that I wanted my drawings to appear lifelike and photorealistic. These blind contours were ugly, disjointed, and crude representations of what I saw in life. Little did I know that this exercise would end up teaching me a lot.\n\n    \n    Blind contours of a statue and a mountain peak.\n\nThree years later, as I walked the cobblestone streets of Fribourg, Switzerland during my study abroad, I was instructed to stop at certain points and do blind contour drawings. These drawings were just as bad and ugly as the drawings I had done years before, but this time I knew more about what I was actually doing. This type of drawing is considered a \u201cseeing\u201d exercise. Since you can\u2019t look at the marks you\u2019re making on the page, you\u2019re activating your brain to see the object more intently, and to translate its image through your hand.\n\n    \n    More blind contours of decorative elements, ancient signage, and statues around Fribourg, Switzerland.\n\nIt\u2019s a really intriguing way to automatically stylize your drawing, almost like a shortcut to creating abstract art. It also reveals what you saw\u2014what \u201clandmarks\u201d were important to your brain in capturing the essence of the object. However, I think this kind of drawing can also help us in our quest for maintaining our humanity while staying integrated with technology.\nFour-Year-Old Values\nIf you\u2019re lacking creative inspiration, go talk to a four-year-old child about something they\u2019ve created recently. I had the pleasure of listening to one tell me about a gingerbread house she made. It took very little prompting, just a little, \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d and pointing at some gummy candies scattered in the frosting outside her little house.\n\u201cOh! Those are the people. And this is where they go swimming. And on the roof, they can sit and\u2026\u201d\nEven better was once she finished describing the house as was typical\u2014each side of the house had a window or a door she could point out\u2014she kept turning the house and suddenly there were more and more wildly creative things to be seen. She was using her imagination to project things that weren\u2019t there onto her candy-covered house. They were at times ludicrous or impossible, but she was only able to stop riffing, not for lack of new ideas, but for her parents\u2019 insistence that it was time for dinner.\nIt is so much easier for small children to see things in simple shapes. I\u2019ve noticed that adults tend to be more reluctant to stare at something for a while and go wild with imagination. We\u2019re much more comfortable with labelling some \u201cthing\u201d as that \u201cthing\u201d that it is, and leaving it there. The door is a door. That\u2019s how it is, and therefore, that\u2019s what it must remain.\nBlind contours are a way to break that mindset, even if temporarily through the laughter as you look back down at your masterpiece to find out it\u2019s not quite the object you were so intensely scrutinizing. It\u2019s also an accessible form of drawing: there is no skill barrier and the product is not supposed to be beautiful or even \u201ccorrect.\u201d\nWhen was the last time you were able to unleash your inner four-year-old and just create something with some scribbles, then tell a story about it?\nSomething More &quot;Practical&quot;\nI love a good creative exercise. It can be really fun, but there are rules:\n\nDon\u2019t judge yourself\nEmbrace the messiness and imperfection\n\nWait a second, those rules kind of remind of most of my therapy sessions!\nI think that play is massively under-appreciated in the modern world, and especially the \u201cadult world\u201d\u2014whether at work or with other responsibilities. We may have been socialized out of childlike behaviors like play and imagination, and yet those are critical components of effective work.\nEven as a developer\u2014a job that most people view as very science-based, technical, and serious\u2014I can\u2019t survive on analytical thinking alone. Problem-identification can require imagination, tapping into the brain\u2019s ability to consider possibilities: Where might this go wrong? How might this work better? Problem-solving requires creativity, especially when you have no idea how to solve some new problem. You have to be willing to play, because the other option is frustration\u2014I\u2019m looking at you, obscure error; I\u2019ll either keep trying and it will magically work out or I\u2019ll send my keyboard through the window.\nSo, yes, tapping into your four-year-old\u2019s mindset may actually be super practical. And it keeps getting better!\nI stumbled on this gem of a TED talk last week: Want to Give a Great Presentation? Use Ugly Sketches by Martin J. Eppler.\nAs the title suggests, \u201cugly sketches,\u201d can actually be really powerful even in the workplace\u2014despite all of the designers cringing at the thought of something so distinct from the Apple-brand knock-off they\u2019ve worked so hard at. Nice graphics have their place, but in this context, ugly sketches can amplify presentations with the goal of collaboration and/or tackling complex topics.\nCollaboration\nThings that are \u201cbeautiful\u201d (think polished or clean graphics) feel finished and untouchable. Just like that vase with the gold leaf inlays and intricate hand-painted designs on a pedestal at a museum, a full-color mock-up of a webpage is something you\u2019ll look at briefly, but won\u2019t interact with. Instead, we\u2019ll skirt around the thing in fear.\nIf, instead, you present a sketchy representation of your mock-up, people don\u2019t feel so scared of \u201cruining\u201d it. They\u2019ll feel more able to say, \u201cthat\u2019s kind of confusing in that order,\u201d or \u201cwhat if we connected this part\u2026?\u201d\nThis is how we get to the root of problems that need to be surfaced and addressed before we go to \u201cproduction\u201d and have a developer create the new webpage or website. Yes, we still need the polished, beautiful mock-ups, but that should be at the very end. Collaboration works best when you start with it, and having \u201cugly sketches,\u201d can spark the conversation.\nComplexity\nMetaphors are really important when explaining complex things. I\u2019ve learned this through many, many failed presentations at work. In all of my voracious learning about the technical details of my field, I lost touch with the fact that no one else cares\u2014and I\u2019ve probably already lost them from the first big word I said (like\u00a0URL\u00a0or\u00a0code).\nIn the TED Talk, Eppler gave an example of how a boss of his started a complex presentation by providing a quick sketch of a fortress built on sand. It was a visual metaphor that was easier to digest and remember than the 40 slides that Eppler had prepared for the presentation. The metaphor helped people connect to the analysis and understand their findings.\nThere\u2019s also something much more human about that approach. Drawing is a technology in itself; a form of communication. It\u2019s almost a story, captured in lines and textures, rather than in the shapes we call \u201cletters.\u201d Artists don't have sole claim to drawing\u2014anyone can make an &quot;ugly sketch&quot; and still get the point across.\nHumans need stories, not bullet-points and huge data charts. We can handle complicated plots and twists and turns in a story\u2014why not take your complex topic and put it in the form of something we can follow more naturally?\nCyborg Scribbles\nBlind contour drawing isn\u2019t the answer to everything, but it is a great way to get comfortable with imperfection, create drawings without worrying about skillset, and get in the mode of visual story-telling.\nWhen we abandon the boring, conventional, stiff methods of communication, choosing instead to engage in play and story, we may find better results from our work (and other venues).\nIronically, those childlike skills are just what we need to reinsert humanity into the world we\u2019ve created with technology. So take every advantage of scribbling! At least for me, it\u2019s been helpful to approach things with a little bit more levity, and less pressure to be perfect.\nWhat do you think?

I first heard it as, \u201cWhat I say\u00a0is.\u201d Regardless of the truth of these \u201cmeanings\u201d of the phrase, the concept is what I find intriguing: Creating reality through language.\nIn a way, programming is that very thing. We use programming\u00a0languages\u00a0to create digital reality\u2014and it\u2019s a reality that absolutely affects, influences, interferes, and integrates with physical reality.\nAs I reviewed my massive codebase\u2014I say\u00a0my, because I\u2019ve been the sole developer on this project the entire time from its conception\u2014it struck me that the entire system that powers my teammates\u2019 online marketing efforts is entirely from my mind (or at least has passed through my mind).\nMy brain has synthesized competing objectives into accommodating processes. It has consolidated issues and desires, it has discovered ways to extend reach and minimize frustration with online publishing. In a way, everything you see on the company website is there because I \u201cspoke\u201d it into reality\u2014bugs and all!\nKnowledge Work\nCode is not the only way for us to \u201cspeak\u201d something into reality. It is any knowledge work that provides us with this godly power. The capacity that we have as humans to understand systems and to work within them is unique, especially as we consider what artificial intelligence is able to do currently.\nIs this the final piece that we humans have over AI? Perhaps that\u2019s a topic for another day.\nWhat I do know is that our minds have a great impact on our collective reality. This encompasses creators and consumers; leaders and workers; privileged and unprivileged; included and excluded.\nAll of our minds contribute to our reality in some way.\nBinary Complexity\nThe second component to what has perplexed my mind as I\u2019ve thought about how \u201cwhat we say\u00a0is,\u201d is the binary paradox.\nThere are so many examples we can look to that encourage us to think in terms of binaries. Male and female. Black and white. Old and young. It\u2019s a ubiquitous way of thinking, reinforced by social constructs\u2014especially in terms of gender and race.\nWe can even be convinced by our brain to perceive threats where there are none (thanks to trauma and/or other factors). It becomes all about the extremes. Everything is terrible or perfect. You're either with me or against me.\nUnfortunately, \u201cblack and white thinking\u201d as it\u2019s called in psychology is not only limiting, but it\u2019s also largely inaccurate. In case you missed this diagram from a few emails ago, here it is again ;)\n\n    \n    \"All of this is gray,\" referring to an entire gradient, excluding the very ends which are completely white and completely black.\n\nThe more we know about any topic, the more nuance we discover. The more we study humans, the more complex we become.\nWe may love our jokes: \u201cThere are two types of people in this world\u2026\u201d but if you add up all of those joke variations, you get a whole lot of types of people in this world.\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m calling the binary paradox. Let\u2019s go back to programming really fast to get at this a little deeper.\nBinary Roots\nMany of you will likely have heard that computers ultimately understand binary at the very lowest level of its complex architecture. \u201cBinary\u201d is a way of encoding information through sets of ones and zeroes. A \u201cone\u201d represents \u201con\u201d and a \u201czero\u201d represents \u201coff.\u201d\nIf a computer ultimately is built on these two signals, how in the world can I watch videos made by someone across continents? How can I see different colors on my screen? How can I order a pizza on my\u00a0phone\u00a0without actually calling anyone?\nThe amazing things that we are able to do on our computers is built on binaries: billions of billions of binaries. We don\u2019t see the binaries anymore (unless you\u2019re a college student or just obsessed with computer science), because we\u2019ve added layers on top of the on-off signals.\nBinary gets turned into a programming language, which then turns into YouTube or a pizza app or a website.\nDespite its appearance of simplicity, binary has allowed us to do incredibly complex things with our technology. This is where my metaphor gets a little shaky, but I think it still holds up a bit longer, let me explain.\nThe reason that binary works to power great complexity is because of\u00a0combinations\u00a0and\u00a0sets\u00a0of binary values. The character &quot;a&quot;\u00a0that you see in this email is represented by this binary set\u00a001100001, also known as a byte. 1,000 characters make up a kilobyte.\n\n    \n\nWe can use those characters like I am in this email: as direct communication with a human. Or we can use those characters within the framework of a programming language to communicate with the computer: Create this layout, this functionality, etc. A single\u00a0bit\u00a0(a one or a zero signal) is simply insufficient.\nBlack and white thinking is a kind of cognitive binary, where only the farthest points on the scale or the spectrum are acknowledged (black or white, yes or no). While a computer can only read electrical signals interpreted as \u201con\u201d or \u201coff\u201d binary, we can do much better.\nA binary system of thinking is a shortcut, a way to condense an immense and incomprehensible amount of information into something that we can easily understand. Male and female: done. \u201cBlack\u201d and \u201cWhite\u201d as race: done. Except that isn\u2019t the reality. (1)\nWhile a computer can build complexity with the simplest of systems, we humans seem to be trapped by it. Instead of building greater understanding and complexity, we limit it. We need to break binaries if we want to truly be seen and heard as people. It\u2019s a lot more work\u2014more processing power, if you will\u2014but it provides more space for healthy relationships and human flourishing.\nCyborg\nIf anything else is to be gained from our computer model, it\u2019s the need for diversity. A single\u00a0bit\u00a0is neither representative of nor sufficient for an entire system. A single person cannot be the only voice, the only power, the only creator. It is a combination of many voices that can create better systems.\nWhat we say\u00a0becomes\u00a0reality. Our language is powerful, because it affects everything from how we think to how we influence others. Who we allow and don't allow to speak also has life-altering impacts on our reality. What is spoken can build and it can also destroy.\nWhile I may have been a solo developer, I was using an inherited language (python) that was created by many other people. I was using a framework to allow me to focus on building specific functionality, but the vast majority of the system was already there, working behind the scenes.\nI don\u2019t know any binary code, because we have moved several levels beyond it. That which I have \u201cspoken\u201d has become, but it wasn\u2019t because I, alone, spoke. It was in concert with many, many other voices.\n\nNOTES  \n(1) I'm not saying that the categories of male and female or black and white in terms of race don't exist or that they aren't important. However, they are ultimately defined by social context and aren't as simple in reality as they appear to be on paper. If these social constructions cause us to judge ourselves: &quot;Am I man enough? Am I black enough? Am I straight enough?&quot; maybe there's something incomplete about how we frame these as binaries?\n Tags: "}, {"title": "In Defense of the Hard", "category": "Newsletters", "href": "/newsletters/in-defense-of-the-hard/", "body": "Choosing to confront hard tasks, rather than avoiding them through technology, can reconnect us with our humanity and resilience. \u00b6 The promise of technology is to make things easier. Humans learn the most through hard things: suffering, hard work, mistakes. \nWe're in a paradox already.\nIn college, I somehow made it onto the snareline in marching band my Freshman year. \nThroughout high school, I had dedicated my precious hours before and after school to percussion. Perfecting technique, practicing solos and parts, watching and listening to ensembles and marching bands and DCI (Drum Corps International).\nIt was an incredible moment to hear my name called after try-outs: &quot;Jess Brown: Snare.&quot;\nI was so out of my league. Even with all of the practice and all of my time, passion, and energy, I really wasn't as good as the other musicians there. I had to work twice as hard to keep up with people who could magically sight-read complex rhythm patterns.\nSight-reading has always been my Kryptonite. I've practiced it for years and years, and it just doesn't come for me. I have to memorize my parts. Blast through everything over and over and over again. At one, mortifying moment, my esteemed, decorated percussion professor had me in for a private lesson and discovered this weakness. He told me, &quot;You were a snare\u2014I thought you were good.&quot;\nThat was the end of my pursuit of music in college. Even though I had proven myself at every performance, every concert, every band practice, every football game, the one chink in my armor\u2014inability to sight-read\u2014meant I was a failure.\nI only had that one year of music in college. It was so important to me, and I failed.\nWhy Do Hard Things?\nLast week, I happened upon a video about Drum Corps and how intense it is. Even though I never had a true Drum Corps experience, marching band in college had a similar feel to it. This video brought back all of the emotions, the satisfaction, the feeling of victory when you play well together.\nThat Freshman year was so fundamental to my growth as a young adult, even with the bitterness of utter failure seeping into my memories.\nI didn't have to pursue music\u2014I had already declared my major as Fine Arts: Graphic Design. And yes, I did get a scholarship to be on the marching band, but that wasn't even a part of my motivation (though certainly a perk).\nI pursue music because it moves me. \nIt is the hardest thing I've ever learned. I was used to book-learning and that came easy for me. Nothing about music comes easy for me. It is a brutal, unrelenting, painful thing and I just can't get enough.\nSometimes it's the hard things that make us feel the most satisfied. Sometimes it's the hard things that help us make the most progress.\nIt's trite, and cliche, I know. But the wisdom that created these platitudes is still wisdom despite the platitudes.\nChoices\nWith technology removing so many of the stumbling blocks to do things like gain access to education and entertainment, make money or take payments, create content and consume it; we have an increased responsibility to make choices.\nThe world I grew up in (pre-smart phone) demanded less of my attention. I was able to follow the structure of school and chores, but outside of that, I could just choose to do things I wanted to do, even if my pool of choices was somewhat limited.\nIronically, the post-smart phone era introduced more choices, but my ability to choose was hampered by all of the attention-hacking.\nI don't think we have the luxury anymore of choosing not choose. I don't sit around bored like I used to. If I have time available, then I better be using it for XYZ projects or playing a video game or watching YouTube.\nThe ease of access to things through technology has made it harder to do hard things. It can remove momentum or friction\u2014both of which we need to pursue hard things.\nBack to the video about Drum Corps (timestamp: 14:50), a young man said something that caught me by surprise.\n\n    &ldquo;I think it's a life lesson of learning discipline, actual life lessons, and just how to be a human in a world full of, like, screens and chillin', and wanting everything\u2014almost like a microwave...\n    &ldquo;I learned how to be more financially responsible, just so I could save up to do this activity. So I think this is a really good slap in the face of what humans are actually capable of if they...just decide. It's the definition of going after what you want; ...Drum Corps at its finest to me.&rdquo;\n\nSo, dear Cyborg, what can you do to re-engage with your humanity? What might help you explore your potential?\nNuance\nAs a final note, I don't want this to be a guilt-driven message. We all still do hard things despite our technology\u2014life is hard, full stop.\nMultiple Sclerosis is my un-chosen hard thing. I have to deal with this chronic illness regardless of technology or privilege, just like you all have at least one thing that is utterly terrible and difficult.\nIt's not just &quot;hard for hard's sake,&quot; it's not, &quot;push through,&quot; it's not, &quot;you can sleep when you're dead.&quot;\nHard doesn't mean destructive.\nIt's finding something outside your normal that will inspire and teach you, even as you endure it.\nFor me, I've been trying to play more with my exercise time. I want to inject creativity into the daily grind of mandatory activity to keep my MS at bay (as much as that's possible). \nAs that becomes easier, maybe it's time to get back to the drums\u2014I guess we'll see!\nWhat will it be for you?

Why was she going to die? Was this about suicide? Was it paranormal (as is common for Buffy in this TV show\u2019s world)?\nDoing her best detective work, Buffy ends up saving Cassie from being sacrificed to a demon (twice), and even catches a crossbow dart in mid-air that had been hurled toward Cassie\u2019s face.

You\u00a0can\u00a0make a difference,\u201d Buffy encourages.\n\u201cAnd you will,\u201d Cassie responds somberly, scrutinizing Buffy.

Cassie had told Buffy multiple times throughout the show that there was nothing she could do; she didn\u2019t know how or why she would die on Friday, just that she would.\nAll of the other predictions she made throughout the episode came true. So why did I, as a viewer, believe that Cassie would be wrong this one time about her death? Part of it, of course, is because\u00a0Buffy The Vampire Slayer\u00a0is still a TV show where super-heroic things happen and many times that means that against all odds, the super-heroin, Buffy, saves the day and puts everything right. Part of it, too, is that all of the other predictions Cassie makes are inconsequential: staining a shirt, getting a B minus on a test, etc.\nMaybe it's easy to predict the small-stakes events. There's enough ambiguity to excuse the predictions away as coincidence. Who knows? Perhaps when we convince ourselves that a prophecy is actually a prophecy, we act in a way that makes it happen.\nWhen it comes to mortality, however, I feel a resistance to believe a prophecy like the one in the episode. I don't think we (generally) want to know how we will die or even\u00a0that\u00a0we will die. Whether a prophecy or a diagnosis, it is exceptionally uncomfortable to consider your ending.\nAs someone with a chronic illness that will likely cause my ending, I found this particular episode rather powerful. Buffy closes the episode by solemnly talking through the experience with her friends.\n\n    \n    Buffy, the Vampire Slayer, Season 7, Episode 4 \"Help\"\n\n\u201cCassie didn\u2019t know? Then it was fate?\u201d her friend, Willow, asks when Buffy reveals that Cassie\u2019s mom never told her about the potential heart condition.\n\u201cThen she was gonna die no matter what, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d Another friend, Xander, says. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter what you did.\u201d\n\u201cShe just knew,\u201d Buffy says quietly. \u201cShe was special. I failed her.\u201d\nBuffy\u2019s sister interjects: \u201cNo. You didn\u2019t, \u2018cause you tried. You listened, and you tried. She died \u2018cause of her heart, not \u2018cause of you. She was my friend \u2018cause of you. I guess sometimes you can\u2019t help.\u201d\n\u201cSo what then?\u201d Buffy asks. \u201cWhat do you do when you know that? When you know that maybe you can\u2019t help?\u201d\nTechnology and Gods\nI think we lean on technology a lot like we anciently relied on gods. Borrowing the scholarship of Dr. Dan McClellan (I don\u2019t yet have specific references to provide here, but I will be revisiting this topic when I do), one of the common functions of ancient gods was to provide special knowledge.\nAs mortals, we have limits on our sight\u2014both physical sight and our ability to \u201cforesee\u201d or plot out future events. For sighted people, being unable to see can make us uncomfortable. Coming face-to-face with death, especially our own, is like another level of blindness\u2014we can\u2019t physically see past it, we can\u2019t perceive anything else beyond that point.\nWe long for prophets that can give us a heads up when something painful is coming. What's the weather going to be like while I'm traveling? Am I making the right decision? What's the answer? Whether the prophecy comes from a god, an ancestor, a seer, or technology, we crave the state of knowing. At least, that\u2019s been my experience.\nMany commenters on my YouTube videos have shared painful stories of undiagnosed symptoms, plaguing people for years. The unknown is torturous. Why can\u2019t the doctors tell me what\u2019s wrong? Why can\u2019t we name this thing that is affecting my life?\nSo in the case of Buffy and Cassie, is it any better? Cassie knew she was going to die\u2014she had the special knowledge and she knew it was certain. The character was portrayed as a previously brilliant student, a curious mind, and an explorer at heart. Once her death was revealed to her, she declined. Grades plummeted, depression crept in. She mourned all of the things she wished could have been in her future.\nParadox\nThere is no comfort here. Whether in knowing or not knowing, there is no\u00a0comfort.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean there is no peace, nor hope. However, I think we\u2019re quick to grasp for answers and shallow appeasement when we consider our humanity and our mortality.\nI return to Buffy\u2019s question: What do you do when you know that you can\u2019t help?\nKnowledge did not prevent Cassie\u2019s death. \u201cFate\u201d was not thwarted. What\u2019s the point, then? When disasters strike, when tyrants are elected, when sickness infiltrates, when you no longer have control, what do you\u00a0do?\nI feel the temptation to wrap this up beautifully, but I think this uncomfortable paradox is worth mulling over. Don\u2019t let yourself fixate on an answer this time. Just consider.

The part that you see without seeing. It is generally empty\u2014though that doesn't necessarily mean it's colorless nor that it has literally nothing in it. \n\nWhen inexperienced people design something, you'll see massive violations of white space\u2014we pack as much information or content as possible into the composition. The busier our design, the more comfortable we feel, but the less effective the design has become.\nIf a design does not respect the white space, it becomes difficult to read or understand. It increases the likelihood of confusion or frustration. It ruins productivity under the pretense of greater productivity.\nWe do this with work and side projects and social media. Fill up all of the silence, all of the downtime with something. Got 5 minutes? Better do something productive, you won't have that break later!\nWhite space is easy to ignore, squash, devalue. But it has a massive cost.\nAll of us need time to breathe. All of us need rest to counterbalance our activity. \nWhite space is what brings balance to our work. It adds that space\u2014literally\u2014to our designs and helps our eyes rest when we're reading. It adds time to think, process, and consider. It is the most critical, but hardest to achieve element to success.\n\n\nThus, it might be something that provides the value, but it is nothing that provides the utility.\n\n\n    \u2014Ch. 11, Dao De Jing, Translated by Roger Ames &amp; David L. Hall\n\n\nHorror Vacui\nThis is the fear of empty space.\nWe know that even &quot;nature abhors a vacuum.&quot; So this is something we have to intentionally cultivate. It doesn't usually come &quot;naturally,&quot; and it's also easy to overdo once you are more comfortable with the concept.\nThe thing is, we do naturally appreciate well-balanced empty space. It's all around us from the text we read, to the interior spaces we inhabit, to the use of our time and attention.\nWhy is it so hard to generate, then, if it's so easy to appreciate when it already exists?\nPerhaps there are some cultural elements hiding in the background of this question. If you're more familiar with Western culture and philosophy, there tends to be an absence or at least a devaluing of &quot;empty spaces.&quot;\nThe skill of seeking and protecting negative space will be critical to develop if we want our humanity to shine through from under technology's black-out curtain.\nThe Millennial Pause\nI was watching a Gen Z creator explain his process for creating viral Shorts videos on YouTube. \nHe described how he is relentless in removing silences, and then dropped this phrase I hadn't heard before. &quot;Get rid of the Millennial pause,&quot; after the hook at the start of a video.\nDumbfounded, I realized that the insidious aspect of horror vacui is real, and I believe it's dangerous.\nI have not doubt that this creator sees a correlation between cutting out every silent moment and the retention of his videos' viewers. But I'd venture to say that the tactic of removing all pauses and silences is not the true cause of retention.\nIt's just so easy to jump into the race to the bottom where we optimize anything and everything.\nBut what do we lose in that race? \nEmptiness, silence, and absence are always the first things to go. We put a table in a room and it will never be clear again.\nThis isn't a problem at first. Until we run out of space. Then we buy more space. Then we run out again.\nThis is what is happening in our brains. We have some space, some time, so we fill it. Until we run out of space. But we can't buy more space for our attention; for our cognitive load.\nI've caught myself too many times over the last few years shoving podcasts, videos, posts, reels, tutorials, music, any content at all into every nook of my mental space. And it's destroying me.\nAnxiety and overwhelm at an all-time high.\nI can't speak for everyone, but I know for myself, it's because I stopped guarding my most precious asset: empty space.\nHow to Practice Adding Negative Space\nAs I've confessed, I'm working my way out of the trap of constant stimulation. So you may be ahead of me or maybe we're in it together. These are some ways I've been exploring to get myself out of it.\n\nChoose silence for as long as you can take it.\nIncrease your output as your input increases.\nTake notes on as many videos / podcasts / books / content that you consume.\n\nChoosing silence\nThis is hard. Even for an introvert like myself, I've found it harder than ever before.\nI've started in increments, though. When I'm doing the dishes, I choose not to listen to a podcast.\nInstead, I save my favorite podcasts for &quot;special&quot; occasions. These occasions have to be long\u2014matching the task length to the podcast length if I'm doing chores, for example.\nIf my task is only going to take a few minutes, I'm all in on that task. I'm not going to start some content if I can't really listen to the whole thing.\nThis has allowed me to insert more silence into my day, more frequently. It also helps me avoid constant attention interruptions.\nIncrease your output\nI heard it said that an input-only system is an explosion. And that's how I've felt recently.\nAs my input increased, my output decreased. My mind has had a harder time focusing and I haven't been as imaginative or inspired by the world as before.\nThis newsletter is one of my attempts to increase my output again.\nYou don't have to do the same thing. Output can absolutely be a private exercise\u2014taking notes and writing your thoughts in Obsidian or other PKM software. Journalling, blogging, vlogging, posting, drawing, singing.\nAny creative endeavor counts in my book. The point is to get yourself engaged in the world again. This gives you an outlet to allow your inputs to inspire you and flow out of you, rather than getting stuck inside and stagnating.\nTake notes\nThis is connected to increasing your output, but it's also a way to slow down content consumption.\nI am addicted to YouTube. I love watching my favorite creators. I love creating videos on YouTube. But I have noticed I've turned into a larger consumer of content, because I'm so curious about so many different topics.\nMy new rule lately has been to try and take notes on as many of the videos as I can.\nThis slows my watching sessions down (when I stick to the rule, anyway). I can't move onto the next video until I finish writing down my thoughts and references.\nThis obviously won't work for my favorite entertainment-type videos (cat fails, trick shots, other shenanigans by immature adults). But almost 70% of the videos I watch are educational\u2014and that makes them secretly difficult to deal with.\nWhen education is entertaining, I forget the vast majority of what I learned while watching. \nTaking notes helps me remember and process the information.\nWhen I'm watching a video but I don't have a notebook around or just can't take notes like when I'm on the treadmill, I'll pause my session and recite the takeaways I want to remember. I have to remember long enough until I can access my notebook or Obsidian.\nThis has been a great memory practice for me. Double benefits ;)\nCyborg\nTechnology eats white space\u2014and tech companies have intentionally designed products to dominate and trap attention. So we have to make an effort to remain in control and to protect that emptiness.\nWe're fighting our own biology. We're wired to crave information, because that's how we survive.\nNow that we're aware of the problem and that negative space is crucial, we have a fighting chance.\nBreathe in.\nBreathe out.

What would it take to achieve that goal? Is it worth the cost? \u00b6 &quot;Words are built by putting together these stems,&quot; my favorite elementary teacher told us as she handed out a blue sheet of paper. I was astonished at this new idea that words were infused with meaning\u2014built as if by LEGO bricks.\nmiss = to send, like in missile, missionary\nde = down, like in degrade, detoxify\neu = good, like in euphemism, euphoria\nIt was one of the few things I really took to studying as a child. Language was fascinating and powerful\u2014and I did not yet grasp how powerful and even dangerous it could be. \nLater, in my 8th grade English class, my teacher introduced us to the classic book, Utopia, by Thomas More. \n&quot;What do you think this word, utopia, means?&quot; She asked the class. For the first time in a long time, I was compelled, Hermione Granger-style, to raise my hand and proudly answer:\n&quot;It means good place,&quot; I said, having arrived at the conclusion by breaking the word into what I thought was eu-topia. But just as I realized the book she held up for us was misspelled, she affirmed my conclusion and said that while the book was about a good place\u2014a perfect place\u2014its title was not spelled Eutopia. Whether on purpose or on accident, the homophone utopia serves as a reflection of what the novel also explores: is it possible to create the perfect society? \nUtopia as my teacher explained, was &quot;not a place.&quot; Derived from Greek, ou meaning &quot;not&quot; + topos meaning &quot;place.&quot; \nIs that because there is no possibility of a perfect place? Or because it just doesn't currently exist?\nIt surely does not currently exist, and not for lack of effort. We know from literature and history (and current events, unfortunately) that there are a few pitfalls we humans have discovered in that pursuit of eutopia. In fact, it seems like we claim to know it well, but tend to repeat the mistakes or the manipulation so often that I'm even starting to wonder if it's ethical to pursue eutopia. It's an attractive idea: trying to attain a better state and circumstance for everyone, but how do we go about it?\nHomogeneity\nThe trope of sameness and lack of diversity appears in many a dystopian sci-fi show or social critique in literature. Consider Edward Scissorhands, Stepford Wives, 1984, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, or The Giver, just to get started.\nIf I had to design a eutopia\u2014a perfect place\u2014one of the first tools I'd reach for is some kind of unifying goal or vision. However, having the same goal and dogmatically forcing conformity are two different things.\nPerhaps at first, we would imagine things were perfect. We'd have a shared vision, like &quot;liberty and justice for all.&quot; It's a beautiful ideal that many people can get behind. However, as we've seen in U.S. American history, the vision alone has never been realized. While there has been progress, we have never fully disentangled ourselves from our own invented systems of oppression. Racism has not been eradicated by any stretch of the imagination\u2014in fact, it may have transformed into something more insidious and deceptive than it ever has been (I highly recommend reading The New Jim Crow by Michelle Alexander to deep dive into that topic).\nGiven that the U.S. has been attempting to make the vision a reality for almost 250 years, I have to wonder if it would ever actualize even given infinite time. I believe part of the reason for this is the competing value of homogeneity that our people have expressed consistently over time. The racist ideology that was developed in order to categorize humans with dark skin as an &quot;other&quot; is one such evidence for our love of homogeneity (sameness). White Christian Nationalism has been attempting to further construct sameness by oppressing and erasing other minorities like the LGBTQ+ community.\nIf you aren't white, straight, and cisgender, then you are an &quot;other,&quot; which is a threat in the eyes of someone who relies on sameness as a value. Your eutopia falls apart the second that diversity appears in the group. The irony is that a single person grouped with one other single person will already introduce diversity into that group of two people. We all have differences in thought, experience, and values, no matter how slight.\nHomogeneity is a false value, because it cannot even stand at the smallest possible sample size. For large-scale populations, homogeneity is merely manipulation to define one attribute as the grouping standard. Everything else that is compared to that standard must find a way inside or outside, but it is all invented and arbitrary, based on whoever happened to grab the power of influence.\nWe're back to the question of ethics in our building of eutopia: who are &quot;we&quot; to do decide what everyone else should do or be or think?\nLanguage\nControl the language, control the reality.\nIt is baffling how much language impacts our thoughts and our experiences. You've surely noticed this if you speak more than one language. There rarely is a translation that can be made one word for one word. Instead, there is a matching up of experiences between the languages, and that's the best you can do. \nIf we want to attempt to build a eutopia for our small, homogenous group of people, we may want to follow the current U.S. president\u2019s lead and force (or restrict) specific kinds of language to cement power and domination over and against the \u201cothers\u201d that pose a threat to our utopia:\n\nAcross the [U.S.] federal government, agencies have been busy scrubbing photographic and written references about women, people of color and members of the LGBTQ+ community from their websites...\n&quot;If you erase the memory, we really forget the people,&quot; said Alessio Ponzio, whose research focuses on LGBTQ history and women's studies and is a visiting professor at Memorial University of Newfoundland. &quot;It's an act of violence that is very subtle but can really destroy the psychology of people. Basically, 'I'm telling you that I do not recognize you.'&quot;\n(NPR)\n\nI know well what it's like to be restricted by language. There was no doubt I was queer from my earliest memories. However, I grew up in a culture that was so toxic toward any queer identity, that I didn't even know I actually related to the queer community until my late twenties. \nAs an example, people growing up in my cultural context are conditioned to use the phrase &quot;I am struggling with same-gender attraction,&quot; which not only uses incorrect terms, but also introduces shame into an experience that is not shameful. Nevertheless, the insistence of this language is still emphasized and ultimately as a result, suicidality continues to plague both youth and adults in my faith tradition.\n&quot;That's not me,&quot; I would tell myself, &quot;They're the bad people. It has nothing to do with lived experience.&quot; The absence of the language led me to not only misrepresent myself and others, it also kept me in a perpetual state of stress and confusion. How could I explain or express what I was experiencing, when I'm not allowed to talk about it with my straight, cisgender friends? The restriction took a huge toll on my mental health, and effectively put me in a cage for more than two-thirds of my life.\nThe moment that I could speak the words\u2014after having discovered the words to speak\u2014the burden of shame I had borne for a lifetime instantly lifted. And it was instantaneous. Pulling the right words out of my brain and into universe was transformative. That's exactly why we can't have people getting educated, reading certain books, asking certain questions, having an open mind, or using certain language in our utopia.\nTumbling Down\nThere are tools for control. They are time-tested, documented, and effective. It is perhaps the existence of these tools that illustrate the problem of eutopia. If the perfect society can only be constructed by removing the humanity, dignity, and agency of people, then is it even worth the perfection?\nIf there's one thing I've learned from the queer community, it's that it actually is possible to break from homogeneity and still arrive at a peaceful, collaborative, thoughtful, loving society. Queer people destroyed everything I thought was necessary for a good place. In an attempt to maintain a utopia, I was taught that they were the enemy, that they had an agenda, and that they were destroying families. All of that was wrong. Now my country is trying to use the exact same rhetoric at a much larger scale than my smaller religious culture (mind you, it's not like the U.S. has been free of this before, it's just that we're doubling down on it again).\nHomogeneity has been propped up as a value or an identity that grants access to rights and privileges that should be afforded to all. We\u2019ve seen hostility towards ideas like diversity, equity, and inclusion spring up suddenly, when it was rarely spoken about even one year ago, all because of language and rhetoric. For some, this feels like a step toward eutopia. For most, it already is utopia.\nEutopia is very much relative based on who has power and who does not. If a eutopia can only be created by drawing a circle around an arbitrary group and calling those inside it humans, while everyone else becomes monsters, then surely there is no eutopia possible for our species. If unity only comes by defining an enemy among us, we are utopia. \n&quot;Divided, we fall.&quot;\nTo be continued...

What do we have at our disposal to work through it and is there any hope to be found? \u00b6 Over the last three weeks, my wrist has started to weaken and supply me with a lovely dose of pain at any kind of pressure. My ankle decided to follow suit with a pinching pain just for flexing my foot. I don't know what's causing these issues, but as someone with a chronic illness, it's easy to get trapped in anxiety over whether this is another &quot;new normal,&quot; or if it means something worse is coming.\nNot a medical professional here, so none of this is advice. However, I have been filling my head with stories and research and theories over the last year or so to try and better understand the human condition and how to find meaning and purpose despite disability.\nI uncovered something yesterday that I think can be helpful in sorting through all of the painful and confusing experiences that we all go through at one time or another. I always get nervous speaking about ability and disability, because I know that I am not representative of everyone in the disabled community, so please remember that these are my own thoughts drawn out of my own situation. Don't weaponize my story (or anyone else's) to try and manipulate someone into &quot;cheering up&quot; or &quot;pushing through&quot; if they're not ready.\nNervous disclaimers aside, this was my discovery.\nFailed Hope\nMy relationship with the concept of &quot;hope&quot; has been fraught. Most of my childhood, I was surrounded by messages and platitudes about hope that never seemed to be honest. \nCrushing depression and thoughts of suicide pervaded my college experience. It was so intense, I leaned on religious (specifically Christian) ideas about hope, expecting to find some kind of lasting solace or peace. The depression quieted for a while, but it never fully withdrew except by denial. Unfortunately, my craving for hope turned into fanaticism. Perhaps I had been doing it wrong, so the only way to get that hope was an increase in intensity: a scrupulosity that would make Dr. Jekyll proud (or tremble?).\nMy carefully constructed view of humanity, myself, and the world at large was smashed to pieces that awful weekend of Cinco de Mayo when I heard the words, &quot;Multiple Sclerosis.&quot;\nI can't speak for those with disabilities from birth\u2014they should be allowed to express their experiences, and hopefully we'll listen when they do. However, I think a lot of initially able-bodied people have to confront disability at some point. Whether because of age or disease or accident, ability is not guaranteed, but it is expected, making the loss of ability very difficult to grapple with\u2014certainly it was for me.\nThe systems that we are a part of (social, labor, etc.) tend to lean ableist. Meaning they prioritize and may even prefer able-bodies over disabled-bodies or bodies with disabilities. The loss of ability could mean the loss of a career, of community, of purpose.\nWe don't have tools, generally speaking, to handle that kind of loss, especially for the larger-scope disabilities (chronic/permanent). Often, it feels like society doesn't see people as people, but as either productive or burdensome. Something that either adds or subtracts.\nLike Erik Davis writes in TechGnosis (pg. 157):\n&quot;...capitalism has a long and exuberant history of embracing whatever technologies and institutional frameworks, allow it to fit human beings into vast and efficient, megamachines of production and consumption.&quot;\nIf you aren't productive, what other option has been provided for us to see our value?\nThe Thing with Feathers\nThe connection came from deep below my thoughts. It rose to break through the surface as though dislodged from the watery abyss. \n&quot;Hope is creativity.&quot; Or maybe better understood as, &quot;hope comes through creativity.&quot;\nWhile I tend to bristle at the word, &quot;hope,&quot; knowing that it is fleeting, and often wrong\u2014not accounting for reality, and therefore sometimes yet another pain on top of pain\u2014this time I paused to watch where this tiny connection in my mind would go as it floated on my thoughts.\nI know from my work as a developer and even from my designer-days that there are always many solutions to a problem. It's not a matter of finding the right solution, but the better solution. Maybe hope could be found as a by-product of that creative problem-solving process?\nI had been imagining / remembering sitting on the floor, trying to push myself up to my feet, but my wrist was giving out in weakness and pain. As I watched this replica of myself in my imagination struggle to do anything, I started to see ants with a leg missing. I saw the three-legged dog owned by one of the Humanities professors at college, hopping down the hall. I saw nature\u2014usually the cruel creator and destroyer\u2014reveal the possibilities through adaptation.\nIt's still not comforting in the way I might have wanted, but when the will to live is still intact, creatures of all sizes and species have demonstrated that they can go on. They use creativity to figure out new ways to continue on. It's not pretty, it's not the same as before, it's not easy, it's not without pain. But it is a continuation.\nMaybe, like Emily Dickinson wrote,\n\n\u201cHope\u201d is the thing with feathers -\nThat perches in the soul -\nAnd sings the tune without the words -\nAnd never stops - at all -\n\n...hope can exist\u2014persist\u2014as I undertake to partner in creation. Nature doesn't stop, it iterates. It tries and tries, and there is no end state. Maybe my hope really does have feathers, because it is evolving to stay afloat, whether in the waters of despair or in the open sky of possibility.\nCyborg\nThe more I learn about humanity and systems, the more I can see that we do have value. MS taught me that the value I had been ascribing was mistaken. \nIt is not in our abilities, productivity, or output that we are found valuable.\nIt really is in our existence.\nThat we are is already a miracle. That we can collaborate and support each other is yet another.\nWhether in stomaching the loss of ability or freedom or community, there is hope to be found. But it isn't trite or dismissive of the reality that you face. \n\nAnd sweetest - in the Gale - is heard -\nAnd sore must be the storm -\nThat could abash the little Bird\nThat kept so many warm -\nI\u2019ve heard it in the chillest land -\nAnd on the strangest Sea -\nYet - never - in Extremity,\nIt asked a crumb - of me.\n\nPoem source Tags: "}, {"title": "The most important thing to know about humans", "category": "Newsletters", "href": "/newsletters/the-most-important-thing-to-know-about-humans/", "body": "Storytelling isn't just entertainment\u2014it's the core technology shaping our identities, fears, and collective growth. \u00b6 In 2018, I was researching ways to become a better designer when I stumbled upon something that would up-end my entire world view and transform how I understood humanity. It's a technology as old as humanity itself.\nIt all starts with story.\nI had been watching a livestream led by Chris Do on his YouTube channel, The Futur, when he started to describe Joseph Campbell's &quot;Hero's Journey.&quot;\nAfter blowing my mind, I realized that story was more pervasive than I had thought\u2014and more dangerous. But first, let's look at what this Hero's Journey is.\nThe Hero's Journey\nIt is a model of the most common story structures (at least in Western culture). Choose your story\u2014any story\u2014and you can find an almost perfect mapping of the Hero's Journey in that story.\nAs Joseph Campbell summarized it in his book, The Hero with a Thousand Faces:\n\n&quot;A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man.&quot;\n\nThere are several parts within the hero's journey, but the largest themes are: \n\nLeaving the normal world\nFinding a mentor\nGoing through trials\nSome sort of calamity or death\nHero finds a way to win\nReturns home and helps others\n\nLet's look at Harry Potter, since most people are familiar with the story even if they haven't read the books.\nWe meet Harry living a mundane life\u2014perhaps less than mundane, since he's an orphan living with abusive extended family. \nHe is suddenly thrust into the world of magic when Hagrid, a half-giant, tracks him down and tells him that he is actually a wizard and has been accepted into Hogwarts, the school for young witches and wizards.\nAt Hogwarts, he meets his mentor, Albus Dumbledore, who is absolutely key in helping Harry understand (or at least, develop the skills necessary for) the role Harry will play in saving the wizarding world from Lord Voldemort, the force of evil.\nAt long last, Harry is killed and then resurrected (that's actually a typical part of the Hero's Journey), allowing him to ultimately defeat Voldemort and save the wizarding world.\nWe Are Heroes\nObviously, there is no &quot;perfect&quot; model, and some stories don't have all of the elements outlined in the Hero's Journey, but the basic structure is still there, because it's really our story that's being told.\nWe all go through our own journey of transformation in this world.\nJourneys and transformation: that's our most basic, common thread through humanity. It can be seen on a macro scale, looking at civilizations or, arguably, the entirety of human history. It can be seen individually, where each person is making their own way, even among others doing the same.\nWe encounter the &quot;other&quot; world at times, finding ourselves in circumstances previously unpredictable. We often find mentors to help us navigate this new space. After trials or challenges, we emerge as a new creature because of those experiences. \nAnd, quite often, we return to help others.\nStories and Systems\nOutside of (and, perhaps, within) the Hero's Journey, there are still other kinds of stories that are told. Monster stories are one of the most common that I hear today.\nYes, monster stories.\nI find them lurking under disguises of seemingly normal or, at least, human circumstances (kinda meta, if you think about it).\nIt is very difficult to recognize these monster stories without some understanding of the relationship between humans and monsters. This is something I owe to Dr. Emily Zarka.\nHer YouTube series, Monstrum, was the next step in my journey of understanding the impact of story. She has been my &quot;mentor&quot; in sorting through painful experiences, fears, doubts, and even helped me find relief from a monster that I was deeply afraid of since learning about it as a twelve-year-old.\nDr. Zarka's work is something I believe every human needs to be familiar with, and I'll do my best to summarize for this email (but go check it out).\nMonsters are humans. Humans are monsters.\nWe use monster stories to process difficult emotions or situations.\nIn Dr. Zarka's most recent audio book, Serial Killers: Real and Imagined, she explores how serial killers end up as monsters\u2014whether conflated with fictional monsters like vampires and werewolves, or literally receiving the label, &quot;Monster.&quot;\nIt's actually quite common to call violent criminals, &quot;monsters,&quot; especially when a person kills others. Just look at the title of one of Netflix's documentaries: Dahmer \u2013 Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story.\nWhether it's a title or a comment from police in an interview or even the gossip we engage in with our friends, that little label comes up frequently. It can also shape-shift to include labels or words like, &quot;devil,&quot; &quot;demon,&quot; &quot;satan,&quot; &quot;inhuman,&quot; &quot;jinn,&quot; &quot;evil spirit,&quot; and more.\nWhat this means for us is that we are engaging in separation. We are, in a way, defining humanity by excluding violent humans.\nIt's exceedingly uncomfortable to see the humanity in a person that commits horrific murders. If they are human, and I'm also human, what does that mean about me?\nNo, no. That's too scary to consider. Better to just call them a monster. They're not like me. They're not like us.\nNot Like Us\nSocial systems are all around us, and they're not easy to identify until they start to collide with your world.\nLike a rope that starts to fray after so much friction over time, the systems at play are rubbing on us, but it's oh, so subtle.\nHere are the warning signs that the systems in our world are dangerous:\nUs versus them: A group you're a part of uses this framework frequently to simplify the out-group. We ignore the humanity and the complexity of the &quot;other side.&quot;\n\nRepublican vs Democrat\nPro-choice vs Pro-life\nGood vs Evil\nChristian vs Atheist\n\nDemonization: Unfounded claims about other people that make them sound even worse, or try to elicit a disgusted response from you, rather than engaging in thoughtful critique. \n\n&quot;They eat children\u2014how can they possibly be on the ballot?&quot;\n&quot;Should boys and girls just share the same bathrooms at school now?&quot; (Demonizing trans people by blowing out the actual issue into something larger and more absurd.)\n&quot;Queer people are unnatural.&quot;\n&quot;Immigrants are lazy\u2014they're just looking for hand-outs.&quot;\n\nMaking people into monsters is a cop-out, a shortcut. It's a way to soothe ourselves from the discomfort of engaging with difficult topics\u2014not just the abhorrent violence, but other things like maintaining systems of oppression.\nIf we can just make these people seem like monsters, we can exclude them without consequence. \nAs Dr. Zarka put it in her video about the Cyclops, Marginality often equals monstrosity.\nJust Like Us\nThe stories with which we surround ourselves become a part of ourselves.\nStories are a deeply rooted technology of communication for us humans. It is how we have passed down knowledge through generations. It's how we sell products in our businesses today. It's also how we perpetuate harmful ideas and prejudices.\nWhen I started to learn about story, it was with the intention of improving my effectiveness in communication and in being able to manipulate people to see something in a certain way.\nStories are powerful, which means they have access to positive and negative effects.\nAs a marketer, it's been easy for me to become disillusioned for periods of time, seeing people be so easily manipulated with psychology and story.\nContext is the only thing that keeps me afloat. Good products need to be marketed, just as much as bad products will be marketed. Everything we do as humans is an exchange of influence.\nIt's not necessarily manipulation if it truly provides value to a person. That doesn't mean the ends justify the means. At the same time, you can't avoid influencing other people. It's an ethical line around which we dance.\nThat's why I think story is not just something for marketing and sales to know about. It's especially important for the masses to understand, because we'll be aware of the forces at play on us.\nPolitics, business, religion, culture, and every other type of group or interest will have stories built up around and through them. If we cannot recognize the themes inside of those stories, we will be blindly influenced by them.\nWhile it is impossible to avoid the gravitational pull of stories, I've been able to be more comfortable with the influences around me. I can see through tactics or I can appreciate the story and then decide what to do with it.\nKnowing all of this about story gives us the pen of authorship. We can decide to adopt a story or adapt a story. It all depends on the attention we pay and the intention we have as we approach the topics that matter to us.\nIf you want to change yourself, change your story. If you want to help others and dismantle systems of oppression, start telling better stories or stop telling monster stories.\nIt all ends with story.

It also serves as a reminder of the value of simple things. \u00b6 Typography is one of the most Important and fundamental aspects of design. If you strip away all of the pictures, all of the flashy interactions, all of the cool features of any kind of design, typography remains.\u00a0\nThat's because the content\u2014the text on the page\u2014is always the most important part of a design.\u00a0\nIt seems like this concept is getting lost on new designers, especially, but can you blame them? When AI is taking care of more and more things, when apps make everything so smooth and sleek, why bother with the hard, boring basics?\nWell, I'm trying to fight these same impulses in myself. I also needed a place to put all of my previous CYBORG_ newsletters.\u00a0\nSo here's the announcement of the grand opening of:\u00a0\nhttps://cyborgnewsletter.com/\nAside from plugging my own website, I thought I'd offer a couple things that make typography beautiful. Maybe you'll notice these details (or lack thereof) in other applications or websites.\nReadability\nType doesn't have to be readable. But the typographic system of an entire website or book absolutely does. Have you ever been to a website that was just frustrating to read? Maybe you don't know why, but it just made you more tired and it was really easy to give up and scroll somewhere else.\nI was trying to research viruses on this website but it was exhausting to do so despite my high intent to stay and read. The reason? The type spreads all the way across the page. In fact, it's generally advised to keep your line widths somewhere around 50\u201375 characters long. This website's template is almost twice that, making it really hard to sustain deep reading.\nIt's details like knowing how to lay out type that can make a huge impact. The reason line length matters is that your eye fatigues the longer the line stretches out, and especially as you try to go from the end of a line to a new one. It's so much easier to lose your place and re-read lines or skip lines when the start and the end of the lines are so far away from each other, like in the example above.\nA lot of website designers either don't know about this, or still offend this rule because of horror vacui (fear of empty space). If you don't have a strong understanding of typography, you're more likely to center-align your paragraphs and let the text stretch as wide as possible to fill up the space. Ironically, this is yet another readability disaster, adding more fatigue to the eye as you read (and don't get me started on center-aligned type\u2014just leave it left-aligned if you're typing in English).\nWe need empty space to be able to rest our eyes. Cherish that negative space, don't fill it up ;)\nSubtext\nThere's often meaning to be found in a text that isn't directly in the physical words. For example, knowing the historical or political context of a book or an article adds meaning to the message. Works like Animal Farm become more than just an interesting exploration of greed, rebellion, and social dynamics. If we put it in historical context, we can draw connections to real-world events and people.\nTypography offers us a chance to insert more meaning into plain old words, a subtext of its own. We use things like bulleted lists to group multiple ideas together. We can use bold or italic styles to add emphasis within a sentence.\nMy favorite part about web typography is that you can add even more meaning through the use of HTML semantics. In case you're not familiar with HTML, it's the structure of the web. It uses tags to mark the beginning and the end of something: paragraphs, links, bold formatting, all use these tags to surround the text that you want to give extra meaning.\nHTML semantics refers to tags that have this extra meaning (there are some tags that have no meaning, like the famous &lt;div&gt; tag). For example, the abbreviation tag, &lt;abbr&gt; is a way to mark an abbreviation in the text and provide the user with the expansion of that abbreviation, like how HTML is an acronym for Hypertext Mark-up Language.\nI know that's getting into the weeds, but it serves multiple purposes, my favorite being accessibility. When we take care of the visual aspect of typography, we help people read the message. When we take care of the HTML (arguably another aspect of typography), we help people with ranges of ability to still access the content on the page\u2014whether they have low or no vision, cognitive concerns, or any number of other circumstances.\nYou'll notice this on my site and these emails most easily with the captions under images. It's a way to help people who aren't sighted or who have low vision understand the image and gain the context that sighted users get by looking at the image in context. \nDesign elements\nThere is beauty in simplicity. Typography taught me this viscerally. My goal on the website is to lean on the strength of simple things\u2014kind of a meta-message in relation to the CYBORG_ newsletter. It's not perfect, and I will be working on it continuously, but it is a success in my attempt to go back to the basics.\nI can always add more flourishes and visual interest by using classic design elements. But I want to see how far typography can take me. How much can I squeeze out of the text on the page?\nYou'll have to let me know how you like it\u2014and you'll want to visit it at least once on a computer. Phones don't allow for the kind of space needed for nice typographic layouts!\nIf nothing else, I hope this brief intro to typographic ideas helps you notice the world around you. Text and type is an integral part of our environment\u2014physical and digital. How often have you stopped to look at what you're looking at? What are the extra messages you get when you read something? Can you believe how amazing it is that we can read at all? \n\nP.S. There are people even in advantaged countries that aren't literate. I highly recommend looking for ways to help both children and adults get the resources they need to gain those skills. Whether through organizations or through policies affecting education and access to education.\n Tags: "}, {"title": "Technotopia", "category": "Newsletters", "href": "/newsletters/technotopia/", "body": "Digital spaces aren't solving the problems we thought they could. In a connected world where knowledge is at our fingertips, why aren't we in eutopia already? \u00b6 Knowledge is power. We know this through experience, through history, and sometimes through corruption. It feels like the idea of &quot;propaganda&quot; and of partisan- or biased-news would be something that is from a bygone age, thanks largely to the Internet. At least, that's how it was positioned in my view growing up. Jonathan Haidt put it well:\n\n\n&quot;The internet came into our lives in the mid-1990s, soon after the fall of the Soviet Union. By the end of that decade, it was widely thought that the web would be an ally of democracy and a slayer of tyrants. When people are connected to each other, and to all the information in the world, how could any dictator keep them down?&quot;\n\n\u2014Jonathan Haidt, The Terrible Costs of a Phone-Based Childhood\n\nEven before the Internet, we had many assumptions about what a connected world could do for humanity. Consider what Alonzo Jackman predicted about the impacts of the telegraph in 1846:\n\n&quot;...all inhabitants of the earth would be brought into one intellectual neighbourhood and be at the same time perfectly freed from these contaminants which might under other circumstances be received.&quot;\n\nIf we can do research, fact-check, and stay connected to all indexed knowledge that humanity has to offer, how are we still not in eutopia\u2014a good or perfect place?\nIllusion of Place\nI still am generally a technology-optimist. I've spent my entire professional career building websites\u2014virtual places where information or other interactions are available. There are so many delightful experiences that I've had online whether finding niche treasure troves of helpful information or even just browsing ancient documents and images that I could never access by myself.\nThe vastness and the creative potential of the Internet is so attractive that it's easy to forget that these technotopias that I spend my time on aren't the only use-cases available\u2014nor are they the most popular. Putting aside the websites you spend time on for work, where do you go for the majority of your Internet experiences? Social media would be my guess for the vast majority of our leisure-time online, and it certainly lines up with my experience lately. \nMaking your own website can be complicated and technical, in stark contrast to making a social media post. The simplicity of posting to Facebook, for example, has helped draw in and retain vast user bases. This also means that people can use these platforms to grow their content footprint\u2014a body of work, in some sense\u2014which then benefits both the platform and the creator. It is within this system that has, in large part, contributed to a separation of realities among all of us.\nAccording to the Center for Humane Technology, social media was our first large-scale interaction with artificial intelligence (AI). As an attempt to solve the problem of drowning in the exponentially growing amount of content generated by the users of social media platforms, AI was made to sort through the mess and identify the things that you, individually, would like to see. People say they have to cater to &quot;The Algorithm,&quot; and they're right. The AI is constantly looking to be fed more data and more content so that it can then serve it to you, hot and fresh (yes, all food puns intended).\nAs technology has progressed and monetary incentives have solidified for the companies running the social media platforms, we've ended up with a utopia. Not to be confused with eutopia (a good place), utopia means &quot;not a place,&quot; and indeed, the Internet is no place, despite how much it feels like it is.\nWhen we experience a place by walking around it, soaking in whatever stimuli is available to our senses, we develop a kind of the reality that the location encapsulates. As we see other people in our surroundings, it's natural to guess that they are also inhabiting the same sensory reality that we are. I think this is the same in abstract locations, like knowledge or spirituality. Our ideas and beliefs can construct realities almost as tangible as a stone pillar or a soft canvas tent. The Internet is rife with ideologies, opinions, beliefs, and knowledge, awaiting visitors to come inhabit that space for a moment or to frequently return.\nThat's where it gets difficult.\nThe algorithms at work trying to predict what content we will most enjoy seeing next are also constructing realities around us. Perhaps it has built a large room where many of your friends can sit with you in the shared understanding. When you encounter a friend who has never even seen this building that you've grown so familiar with, it can be jarring. \n&quot;How have you not seen this?&quot; you might ask.\n&quot;How can you stand to be in there?&quot; they might reply.\nThere are groups with malicious intent that can subtly infiltrate our digital spaces and as we become more and more comfortable with their messages which eventually surround us as algorithms boost their content, we can slip into delusion. Take QAnon, a highly successful community built on conspiracy theories, for example. With masterful manipulation techniques, QAnon has targeted vulnerable people looking for validation or for comfort amidst powerlessness, chaos, confusion, or political turmoil.\n\n\n&quot;Beneath these kinds of delusional beliefs, in many instances, is not a desire to be accurately informed, but a need to be internally comforted.&quot;\n\n\n\u2014Jesselyn Cook, The Quiet Damage, pg. 230\n\n\nSo much for our &quot;intellectual neighborhood&quot; being able to free us from contaminants, if we are all at risk of manipulation with something as simple as the track of content being fed to us.\nThere is such a striking difference of realities that we're all subjected to through our utopias, that I've even felt disoriented in the real world as I've moved between various friend groups. \nThat is not to say we have no benefit from our digital realities. The Internet has helped challenge oppressive systems, connect people in constructive ways, and enabled transparency across organizations, governments, and other groups. The paradox of benefit and harm resulting from the virtual world is one that we'll have to hold onto, no matter how uncomfortable.\nAnother Place\nWithout many policies and regulations to help us, we're severely limited in what we are able to do about the realities that are constructed around us. If our technotopia really is like a place, then we may find value in keeping with the metaphor and trying out some tested methods from the real world.\nAs Mark Twain said in, The Innocents Abroad / Roughing It:\n\n\u201cTravel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime.\u201d\n\nHomogeneity, as we explored last week, is insufficient and stifling in real-world attempts at building eutopias, so perhaps we must also fight against it in our sphere of knowledge and virtual experience. However, the sameness of venue is also concerning. I worry that the draw to digital spaces has overpowered our human need to meet in physical spaces. So much of my interactions with my friends are virtual\u2014through texts, shared Instagram reels, etc.\u2014that I am losing not only my social skills, but my ability to connect with people when we are face-to-face. It feels very much like the following observation made by Jun'ichir\u014d Tanizaki back in 1933:\n\n\n&quot;Japanese music is, above all, a music of reticence, of atmosphere. When recorded or amplified by loudspeaker, the greatest part of its charm is lost...Most important of all, are the pauses. Yet the phonograph and the radio render these moments of silence utterly lifeless.&quot;\n\n\n\u2014In Praise of Shadows\n\n\nHas the technology that was supposed to unite us, actually chipped away at our humanity? Or at least dulled the vitality of our connections with each other? Are the manipulated realities to blame for taking us to a place we didn't intend to arrive at?\nI grew up in a culture that was highly averse to differing perspectives. In fact, there were intellectual walls constructed intentionally to ward off the possibility of exploring human experiences, social critiques, and especially any kind of introspection of religious institutions. As a result, I have been stunted in my growth as a human, I have made racist proclamations (always with good intentions\u2014and where does that path lead again?), I have perpetuated harmful beliefs and practices. The amount of actual pain that I have contributed to is immeasurable, but it is finally catching up to me as I have broken free from the restraints that were inflicted on me. Clawing my way out from behind the intellectual walls that prevented me from seeing Others as humans, I'm realizing now that it is vital to seek out different views, different ideas, and different experiences.\nAlthough I have become a much more regular digital traveller, there is still more to do. Our emotional and mental health must become a priority (both individually and collectively). Since our digital utopias inhabit no real space but our own minds, taking care to clean up will help us be more discerning when confronted with manipulation. My life took an incredibly gigantic turn when I made mental health my main focus. Coming from more than twenty years of homogeneity, manipulation, and rage redirected internally, I was at a lowest-of-lows, easily swayed by any idea, as long as it lined up with what was familiar to me, even though it was hurting me.\nGetting out of utopia and into another place is neither easy nor fun, but it is vital\u2014as in life-giving. My country's deep emotional and mental wounds are now manifesting in even greater harm as the current administration is lashing out at groups of people it has determined are monsters, or at least a lower-class of human. Oh, how things might be different if we could reconnect instead of disconnect?\nIn all thy travels, never forget humanity.

It was from a friend I hadn\u2019t seen, let alone heard from for several years. Although it was masked as a Christmas card, inside the festive exterior was a folded up piece of paper.\nIt was absolutely delightful to read.\nIt\u2019s been 12 years since I received a real letter from someone. She was describing some of the things going on in her life, a few thoughts. Even though it was clearly sent to multiple people, it still felt personal\u2014and she invited us (me) to write her back in this very analog, slow way.\nThis friend is a voracious reader\u2014I couldn\u2019t catch up with the amount of books she\u2019s read in five lifetimes. Among the books she read this year was\u00a0How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy, by Jenny Odell (which is now on my to-read list). Inspired, she deleted her social media accounts and has committed to connecting in more \u201creal\u201d ways.\nIt\u2019s an incredible action and while my point isn\u2019t to encourage you to do the same, this commitment demonstrates how powerful reading can be. Has there been a book that has immediately changed your behavior? It\u2019s a beautiful thing to think that something a human created could impact another human, especially without either knowing the other.\nIn step with my friend\u2019s lead, here are the most impactful books I\u2019ve read this year, having to do with our CYBORG_ themes of systems, technology, and humanity.\nManiac Magee, by Jerry Spinelli\nThis book was formative to my fifth-grade self, and I decided to revisit it after 20 years. Re-reading the book that convinced me to remain interested in knot tying (and untying) and to heavily invest in my coordination and balance was delightful.\nThe themes of racism, abuse, and poverty took me by surprise. They were the aspects that I either didn\u2019t grasp as an 11-year-old or simply faded from memory aided by my own privileges.\nDespite being a youth book, I found it an important reminder to approach the world and the systems we encounter with curiosity, just like the main character did. Curiosity and grace, that is. Maniac Magee often allows people to be themselves, even if they are unpleasant or downright cruel.\nI think it's a kind of grace to be able to meet people where they really are and allow the same acceptance to yourself. Maniac doesn't have an agenda\u2014he's just looking for connection. His proximity to a diverse array of people changes him and changes them over time.\nAn Immense World, by Ed Yong\nA rich, dense, can\u2019t-put-it-down introduction to the worlds of senses that are all around us. It\u2019s the most fun I\u2019ve ever had learning constant facts about how other animals or insects perceive their world (their\u00a0umwelt). An\u00a0umwelt\u00a0is a term used to describe the reality that a creature inhabits based on its sensory perception. Instead of only looking at an animal\u2019s environment, it includes how that animal understands and perceives it.\n\u201cOur umwelt is still limited, it just doesn\u2019t\u00a0feel\u00a0that way. To us, it feels all-encompassing. It is all that we know, and so we easily mistake it for all there is\u00a0to\u00a0know. This is an illusion\u2014and one that every animal shares.\u201d \u2014Introduction\nI scrambled to take notes and grab quotes as I listened to this book. If you\u2019re looking to expand your world, this will make universes out of the small environment you occupy. I couldn\u2019t walk two steps out of my house without taking a moment to examine a bug and wonder about its world\u2014its\u00a0umwelt\u2014or consider the birds in flight or the cats in the windows.\nAn Immense World\u00a0might just be my favorite non-fiction book.\nSlow Productivity, by Cal Newport\nDespite hesitations about reading this one, I found it had a lot more depth than your typical \u201cproductivity\u201d book. There are plenty of practical suggestions for productive work, but the idea of slowness was especially compelling for me.\nThrough several stories, such as the Italian \u201cslow food movement,\u201d prolific artist Georgia O\u2019Keefe, and writer John McPhee, Newport paints a picture of the powerful work that can be achieved through the slow, natural, human pace.\nMore than anything, this book brought to my attention the importance of slowness. Although immediacy has become a cultural value, this runs counter to the way humans work and acquire skills. The highest quality is even more premium now that AI is exponentially contributing to fast food style content (images, text, code).\nThere\u2019s always a place for speed, but speed isn\u2019t always the appropriate value, depending on what you\u2019re trying to achieve. Success\u2014whatever that may mean\u2014is a long game. Slowness has and will serve us well if we develop the wisdom and the discipline to invite it back into our lives.\nAncestor Trouble, by Maude Newton\nI hate genealogy. This book grabbed my interest despite my loathing and I couldn\u2019t leave it unfinished. There are so many ways that our biological families impact us\u2014for good and bad\u2014and Newton doesn\u2019t shy away from addressing abuse, privilege, racism, confusion, and connection.\nThe technology side of genealogy and DNA testing is debated for its incredible usefulness and the disturbing potential for harm or exploitation.\nIf you want to understand human relationships with ancestors, this is as good as it gets. My big takeaway was to approach my connection to the past with a bias toward forgiveness. While I\u2019m not in a space where I want to know my ancestors on a deeper level, this book did open my mind to the possibility of approaching them in a healthy way, in my own time, according to my own needs and wants.\nPathogenesis, by Jonathan Kennedy\nI have one chapter left. It was an astounding read.\nOn par with the can\u2019t-put-it-down writing style of\u00a0An Immense World,\u00a0this book is packed to the brim with information, expressed through stories that might be familiar but have a whole new dimension to them.\nDiseases have played an integral role in how great empires were weakened or emboldened, how the North and the South became divided over slavery in the U.S., how religions flourished or were abandoned.\nIt is a breathtaking look at human recorded history, but it also elicited a kind of mourning from me. The massive scope of death and suffering caused by disease, hubris, confirmation bias, and greed is stunning. I think it is worth the painful read to be able to reverence those billions of lives lived and lost throughout history.\nCyborg\nI hope you can find rest and recovery time as the year is ending.\nThe systems at play in our lives\u2014both social and technological\u2014are powerful and, at times, exhausting. From what I\u2019ve learned from the authors above, I\u2019m planning on approaching this next year with curiosity, forgiveness (this one will seriously test me), grace, and questions.\nThere\u2019s a lot of pain, there\u2019s a lot of hardship,\u00a0and\u00a0there\u2019s a lot of connection, there\u2019s a lot of people who care. I hope to be able to hold onto the hope in humanity that we need to move forward together.\nIn the meantime\u2026Have you read any of the books above? Any recommendations for me this next year? Tags: Death"}, {"title": "Honestly...", "category": "Newsletters", "href": "/newsletters/honestly/", "body": "Good design isn\u2019t intuitive\u2014it\u2019s honest. How one of Dieter Rams' principles impacts our day-to-day lives and the systems that surround us. \u00b6 If you poke around industrial and product design, you'll eventually come across Dieter Rams. Rams is a beloved designer known for creating sleek, user-friendly products. Even today, Apple products\u2014from the iPod to the calculator app\u2014reflect designs that Rams created for Braun.\nMore interesting are his &quot;Ten Principles of Good Design,&quot; because I think the violation of one of those principles, specifically, has a huge impact on all of our lives.\nBefore we jump in, I take &quot;design&quot; as a larger concept than just visual design. As Herbert Simon said, &quot;A Designer is anyone who devises ways to change existing situations into preferred ones.&quot;\nGood Design Is...Honest?\nI design custom software for my team at work that helps marketers edit the company websites when they need to. This software is supposed to make it brainlessly easy to make changes to text, swap out images, create new pages, maintain awards and badges and testimonials and on and on.\nWhile there's lots to improve, I often hear kind feedback like, &quot;It's really intuitive.&quot; At first, I couldn't have been more pleased with this praise, but the more I've thought about it, the more empty it feels. What does intuitive even mean in terms of design? It's a great word in a marketing context (although it's over-used, so maybe not so great after all). Like so many other buzzwords, we have to dig deeper to actually figure out what we're talking about.\nI have wondered, for example, how anything digital could be intuitive at all? Does a baby know what to do when a keyboard is placed in front of it? Compared to a pencil, all things digital are not remotely intuitive, since a very small child can intuitively create an artistic expression, however encrypted it may appear. The same child cannot possibly execute the simplest action on a computer without being taught both how and why they should perform that action.\nAlthough I know I'm dangerously close to simply playing with semantics, I think my aversion to using the word intuitive to describe a design is actually helpful for me to make better designs. I can make something intuitive to me all day long, but if it really were intuitive then someone else without my expertise should be able to flawlessly execute or act through my design\u2014and I know that is not the case for anything I have ever designed professionally.\nHonesty of design becomes an intriguing replacement. Instead of hoping a design can be magically recognized and understood, the design now has something to be evaluated through.\nSaying a design is &quot;honest&quot; subtly anthropomorphizes it. Being intuitive is a description of the quality of the design while saying that the design is honest implies that it has the potential to be deceptive\u2014almost having a form of agency. Rather than simply possessing a characteristic, a design takes action.\nThis also matters to us because it changes the direction of responsibility. If a design is just intuitive, companies can excuse any of its shortcomings, opting instead to blame a person who struggles to use the design as being incompetent. On the other hand, if the design is honest, it puts the responsibility back on the product. It's not about the skill of the user but whether that design is successfully aiding its user. It's a subtle shift going from how do I interact with the product? to how does the product interact with me? \nThis also helps us evaluate the things that we're using day-to-day in more constructive way. If I need to make a decision that impacts my privacy or my health or my relationships, using this design principle will help me sort through those choices. When I use certain settings or commit some action, do I trust that this company, this product, this app will do what it says it is doing?\nRams' assertion that &quot;good design is honest,&quot; is crucial to putting humanity back into the flow of the Corporate world. While companies are ultimately systems seeking profits above all else, the only way to keep it from dipping into deception and exploitation is to remember that there are humans interacting with the system every step of the way.\nGood Design Is...Human?\nThere are certainly pitfalls to anthropomorphism (making something that is not human appear to be human conceptually, behaviorally, etc.) as we've explored in previous newsletters. We can make mistakes in our understanding of other living creatures, for example, when we project our human-centered experience onto them. This can even happen human to human: how many times have we assumed that a person took a particular stance or held a preference that we, ourselves, had, only to discover those assumptions were wrong?\nKnowing that, I still think that the assignment of the value of honesty to design is a wise choice. Honesty is a reliable value for us as social creatures\u2014it's one value we can probably all get behind. It also raises the expectation of quality from both the producer and the person using the product.\nIt is more critical now to take on that responsibility of honest design as a creator, because our world is so easily filled with dishonest or less-honest design. Everything from processes making it hard to cancel a subscription to products that simply don't do what was promised or expected.\nI think that design is the way that we can package up human-centered values at work. We may not have a lot of control over the largest systems in our lives, like our government, our social systems and culture, but in my experience, we can have a lot of impact through our work. \nFor the last four years, I've made a raucous about accessibility, which is a term I use to group any design or development choice to make our websites more easily usable by people of any ability (including those with no or low vision, cognitive impairments, those with fine motor impairments, etc.). Not only has this helped us serve more people, I think it has also impacted our Marketing team culture\u2014it has been a way to encourage people to consider the implications of the choices they make.\nIn a world where profit often competes with humanity, honest design could serve as a safeguard against (some) exploitation. It's idealistic, but what else do we have?

I had gravitated to the quiet space for a special exhibition, partly grateful for a break from my peers and partly intrigued by this bizarre room of white paintings. Even then, I had been skeptical of &ldquo;modern art,&rdquo; and despite the inclination to arrogantly dismiss a painting that was monochromatic, something about the collection's topic, shanshui, drew me towards the room that was completely ignored by the other students.\nThe full title of the exhibition was Shanshui\u2014Poetry Without Sound? Landscape in Chinese Contemporary Art. The handout that I still have explained that shanshui is made of the symbols for &ldquo;mountain&rdquo; and &ldquo;water&rdquo; in Chinese and shanshui painting has been developing for over 1,500 years.\nDetermined to be respectful to the artist and to prove to myself that I was taking to heart everything I had learned as an art major in college, I entered the room and approached a wall. It seemed like all of the paintings were some kind of cross-hatched noise of extremely similar tints of white. \nConfused, I read from the handout:\n\n&ldquo;At first glance, Qiu Shihua's works seem to be a white canvas with a monochrome, milky surface. Only on careful and extended examination does a rural scene...slowly emerge from the apparent emptiness.&rdquo;\n\nMaybe it was cheating\u2014maybe it was psychological priming\u2014but now I knew what to look for. Everything was so still and quiet, this was my chance to put this claim to the test. I took a seat on the bench near the center of the room and concentrated on one of the paintings.\nSlowly, but surely, I saw it. From the subtle visual noise, I started to see shapes\u2014trees\u2014rise out of the still image as if there was a small cloud of fog obscuring my view of a forested landscape. \nI was stunned.\nI've rarely been so touched by artwork in a gallery. I stayed there, appreciating every white painting. That's the first time I realized that art is less about looking and more about listening.\nThe Hardest Skill\nEveryone says listening is important. Everyone says it's hard. Everyone says, &ldquo;you gotta be engaged and not just be waiting to say what you want to say next.&rdquo;\nWhen I hear these trite explanations or platitudes or &ldquo;consensus&rdquo; views about listening, it just feels awful. No wonder no one listens\u2014ha!\u2014to the advice, it's so bland and cringy. \nInstead of a lecture on listening, this introvert is going to lay out a couple of the things I've leaned on over the years that have helped me listen, because I think it's a skill that many people want to learn, but it's not easily accessible in the ways we normally talk about it.\nEars\nIn any communication, there has to be a transmitter and a receiver. With colors, the bright, saturated ones are able to force transmission to our receivers (eyes) with greater ease\u2014you might say they're eye-catching. It's easy to be attracted to bright, bold colors, sometimes even called &ldquo;loud.&rdquo; Colorful artwork tends to draw in crowds or elicits remarks from onlookers like, &ldquo;I really like this one...&rdquo;\nThis same pattern emerges in social situations. We have loud voices\u2014whether through intensity of sound (volume) or through quantity of speech. It's easy to listen to these voices because they cut through the noise or command attention through social cues and conditioning. \nI'm not about to make the case that we shouldn't be listening to these loud voices. By all means, continue to do so. However, if we really want to cultivate our listening skills, I've found it helpful to pick out the medium and quiet voices as a way to practice more productively. It's like finding the right signal on a radio: it takes conscious adjustment and sometimes you have to be tuning and retuning the entire time\u2014and it can be quite exhausting!\nInterestingly enough, nature seems to have considered the noise issue, because it's not just conversations at a social party where we meet noise. It's all around all of us, every creature, all of the time. \nConsider how birds listen to each other, sometimes amidst a whole chorus of other birds. Listening is tough in an environment saturated with similar noises, but nature has various ways of approaching the problem. As described in the phenomenal book, An Immense World, by Ed Yong:\n\n&ldquo;Part of the thrill of listening to animals comes from wondering what they're saying to each other...Naively, we might imagine this to be a problem of vocabulary, as if there might exist some word-to-chirp dictionary that would suddenly allow us to speak bird. There isn't...\n&ldquo;The communication barrier between species is also a sensory one.&rdquo;\n\nYong goes on to explain birdsong and how, despite our human ears assuming the chirps and whistles are basically the same thing over and over, there is more going on. In the section on the chickadee and white-breasted nut hatch, we find our listening advice:\n    \n    &ldquo;Both birds completely retune their sense of hearing from one season to the next to process the information that matters most in that season. Their voices and their needs change with the calendar, so do their ears.&rdquo;\n    \nThis is something we can do on the micro and macro scales of our lives. Sometimes we need to be listening to the loudest voices in the room (or at work, in the country, and the world). Sometimes we need to retune our ears to pick out the smallest voices; the ones most often ignored; the ones from oppressed groups.\nIn that art exhibition in Switzerland, I stepped out of the noise of bright colors and human voices. I had to settle into the new ambience and assert my intention to be there with my whole self, taking my time to consider, to take in information, and to contextualize myself. After all of that, understanding flooded in.\nVoices\nWhile I tend to over-invest in the receiving end of listening, our bird friends are also showing us it's ok to retune our voices as well. Speaking to others in ways that will help them feel heard. Speaking on their level of understanding. Speaking to them in ways that reflect their humanity and dignity. Tuning our voices may well be one of the most impactful practices of our attempts at listening.\nI'm not convinced that speaking is the only way to tap into our voices. Of course there are other venues of communication like writing and art. In terms of listening, I wonder, can you use your &ldquo;voice&rdquo; in silence? \nPsychology 1010 was the first time I considered a different means of communication. Not all communication has to be yours, as in your thoughts and your transmission of information. My professor told us stories of experiments that showed how an audience could control the &ldquo;performance&rdquo; of a lecturer. It's not through sound. It's through engagement.\nIf a crowd of students looking down or looking up at the professor could control where the lecturer stood, I can't help but assume our voice is so much more than what we say\u2014in whatever medium we choose to say it.\nResponding to the transmission that someone else sends to you is vital. It helps both parties feel connected and safe. Our voices impact our listening at its core, because sending and receiving a message requires both the &ldquo;ear&rdquo; and the &ldquo;voice&rdquo; from both sender and receiver. I think real communication can never be &ldquo;one-way,&rdquo; but is only possible &ldquo;two-way.&rdquo;\nSometimes, we can delegate or defer our voices to others who aren't heard. Elevating the voices of minority or marginalized groups is yet another way we can use our voices\u2014not so that we can be heard, but so that those groups can be heard as we give space and opportunity for their voices to project.\nThe moment I started to see the landscapes rise out of the white noise on the paintings, I was connected to another person's expression. My physical voice was silence, but the response I made was no less real. Like a tuning fork, I was resonating as the art sent its message to me and I picked up that message.\nCyborg\nThe world is noisy, but as nature shows us, it always has been. The trouble isn't the noise itself, but the work we have to do stay resonant to what matters. Listening is work and it's worth every effort.\nUnfortunately, technology can accidentally or intentionally build up echo-chambers around us that create a further barrier to our listening practices. It makes the skill of listening that much harder to tap into because we aren't exposed to the different voices that ask us to retune our own ears and voices.\nWithout retuning as a consistent cadence in our lives, I fear we are prone to listening-loss, a metaphoric noise-induced hearing loss. Maybe listening to those you've never heard before, reading banned books, or considering alternative points of view is actually crucial to our social health after all?\nIt might be easier to draw from nature, again, as we consider what listening can do for us. If what Ed Yong says is true (again from An Immense World):\n\n&ldquo;When we pay attention to other animals, our own world expands and deepens. Listen to tree-hoppers, and you realize that plants are thrumming with silent vibrational songs. Watch a dog on a walk, and you see that cities are criss-crossed with skeins of scent that carry the biographies and histories of their residents...&rdquo;\n\n...then maybe the effort to listen can reopen our worlds and break through the barriers we find ourselves trapped within. The landscape will begin to clear the fog, even if slightly, and we'll be able to find common, familiar ground where once was just noise.

Ironic as it may seem since my job is very heavily documented, technical, and (in a way) scientific, these mystical descriptions track with the subconscious culture of technology.\nThe first time I encountered the idea that there was a mystical or spiritual aspect to how we humans interact with, build, and explore technology was listening to this podcast:\nCan Myth Teach Us Anything About the Race to Build Artificial General Intelligence? With Josh Schrei. Turns out, there is a whole lot more out there and I've only started scratching the surface in the literature about myths and machines.\nThe unnecessary praise I've gotten at work has been gratifying. There's something to being called a wizard that is comforting in times when there is so much uncertainty about the future of work, because it tells me that my team does not understand what I do at all. If they don't understand it, they respect that I can &quot;command&quot; it so well. That comes with power imbalances, however, and puts a lot more responsibility on me to make sure that I am being honest and open about my work. \nI've taken the stance that teaching, sharing, and presenting about technical things is how I can release some of the power imbalance that I've created (though many people still just don't care, which is fine). At least it demystifies on record what I do and why I need to do those things\u2014I'm a magician that openly shares the tricks. That approach has been deeply criticized by actual magicians, and yet, like my favorite magician, Chris Ramsay, has said:\n\n\nI think people should be exposed to more magic. I think 20-30 years down the line, people go to magic shows they'll be able to discern good magic from bad magic and I think they they have the right to know the difference...By keeping secrets from them...keeping them out of the loop, well, you're essentially depriving them of enjoying the art form the way that you enjoy it. They should be able to choose.\n\nWhile being associated with magic is thrilling to me, since I love the world of magic\u2014tricks, illusions, etc.\u2014I had a disturbing experience just last week as the attribution finally escalated.\n&quot;Since Jess is a god, we can now do this...&quot; my teammate said in a meeting.\nI've finally reached my peak, I suppose. If the scale starts at magician, what can be above deity? To be clear, I don't care that his language was (obviously) hyperbolic nor am I offended in some kind of spiritual sense as though it were blasphemous. There's no concern of mine that my ego will be so inflated as to actually believe I'm on par with any form of deity, there's no concern that I will be worshipped.\nSo why, then, was I so unsettled by the comment?\nThe Problem Starts to Brew\nMuch of what I'm seeing right now as generative AI is being used everywhere\u2014including in my own code\u2014is an abstraction of knowledge and skill. It is easy to criticize AI and those who use it without any attempt to judge its output, but now I'm just as concerned with those who use AI, even with expertise. There is danger in using AI for research, for the creation of code, for advice, when it's so easy to use and to trust. \nIn a way, many knowledge workers are not in danger of being physically replaced by AI in the sense that AI will take our jobs from us, rather the threat right now seems to be that our intelligence will be replaced by artificial intelligence. We trade our actual intelligence for the artificial when we offload our critical thinking, our processes, and our hands-on work to the &quot;robot.&quot; As Marshall McLuhan said way back in the 1960s:\n\n&quot;We are all robots when uncritically involved with our technologies.&quot; \n\nCan the same be said about spiritual or mystical ideas like worshipping of a deity? Something like: &quot;We are all robots when uncritically involved with our gods.&quot;\nI think so. In fact, it's my personal experience that the culture of religion can, if not carefully guarded against, encourage a lack of critical thinking. This is not to say that it is the default state of &quot;religion&quot; to turn off our intelligence, nor does it mean that you cannot be both committed and thoughtful in religious settings. I'm speaking merely from my experience that I was trained to not ask certain questions; to take what I heard from leaders and males in general to be messages from God.\nIf something I saw or heard didn't line up with my values, but it came from the &quot;right&quot; sources (leaders and males), it meant that I needed to figure out the disconnect like a puzzle that had its pieces all mixed up. The whole issue was that I had to prove them right\u2014I was trying to make the puzzle display the picture I needed it to be, rather than the picture that it was.\nPerhaps we've been doing this with technology as well.\nIn my experience with technology in general, I started out completely in love. Surely all technological progress is true progress. Every improved system, every automation run, every pixel properly placed was improving everyone's lives, end of story. The world of code was so vast even fifteen years ago, that I had to lean on the advice of other developers since I had no footing of understanding to call my own.\nOnce again, cracks started to appear in my idealized perception of the tech world. Cyber bullying through social media; attention spans depleting while being harvested for ad revenue; difficulty connecting with people in real life; exploitation of labor in less affluent areas of the world; the perpetuation of conspiracy theories.\nThe paradox of technology being both monumentally good and bad cannot be buried. Religion has the exact same paradox having done exceptionally good things for humanity, as well as having perpetrated devastating things to humanity. The more flexible we become, the less these spheres of our lives shake us when we confront the uncomfortable parts of their realities. This flexibility, in my experience, is adopting the practice and skill of critical thinking.\nActually, there is precedent for this even with the AI problem. Microsoft published a study in 2025, The Impact of Generative AI on Critical Thinking, which states in the abstract:\n\n&quot;...higher confidence in GenAI is associated with less critical thinking, while higher self-confidence is associated with more critical thinking. Qualitatively, GenAI shifts the nature of critical thinking toward information verification, response integration, and task stewardship.&quot;\n\nWhy does it matter if we practice critical thinking, when AI will eventually take care of everything for us\u2014it only gets smarter, after all? The paper continues:\n\n&quot;Used improperly, technologies can and do result in the deterioration of cognitive faculties that ought to be preserved. As Bainbridge [7] noted, a key irony of automation is that by mechanising routine tasks and leaving exception-handling to the human user, you deprive the user of the routine opportunities to practice their judgement and strengthen their cognitive musculature, leaving them atrophied and unprepared when the exceptions do arise.&quot;\n\nCritical Cyborg\nI am not a god, in case you wanted clarification. I am most disturbed by that label because of the unapproachability that it implies. In many ways, the concept of a deity is something / someone that is far away, untouchable, and bigger than us. \nI'm afraid we don't examine how these religious terms and concepts are built into technology from the very foundation. It makes it so much easier for us to fall into traps of feeling or thinking that our technology is too great\u2014too unreachable\u2014that we have no control of it. How can we control something like a god? We can't. If our technology or those who wield it become gods, then how can we safely interact with it or them? We can't.\nLike the Reverend Mother says at the beginning of Frank Herbert's Dune:\n\n&quot;Once men turned their thinking over to machines, in the hope that this would set them free, but that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them. 'Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a man's mind'...but what the OC Bible should have said is: Thou shalt not make a machine to counterfeit a human mind.&quot;\n\nHerbert's fictional universe is in a post-AI era. He skips over how humanity solved the issue of &quot;men [turning] their thinking over to machines,&quot; but the artifacts remain that indicate that humans took back their thinking. It's chilling to be in a time where AI is no longer science fiction, but something that is actually posing a threat to our actual intelligence, agency, and autonomy.\nI think that religious language in technological settings is a warning sign. I think it indicates that the hidden undertones are now bubbling to the surface, as though technology is finally becoming too out-of-reach, too big, too unwieldy, that we can't help but start calling it like we see it.\nAlthough I will continue to act like a magician who shares the tricks, I'm realizing that it's not enough. Access to good information is not enough, because there are other players that are attempting to enslave &quot;other men with machines.&quot; I don't have the answer, but I do know that it is more important than ever to work on critical thinking skills. Approaching the world with curiosity, rather than with arrogance. Focusing on humanity, rather than on profits.\nWe can't afford to check out of our lives. Let's not become robots by accepting technology the way it is, as though it couldn't be some other way. Let's abandon the dogma that any technology is good technology.\n\n\n&quot;The greatest of America's homegrown religions\u2014greater than Jehovah's Witnesses, greater than the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, greater even than Scientology\u2014is the religion of technology.&quot; \n\n\u2014Utopia Is Creepy by Nicholas Carr Tags: Artificial Intelligence, Humanity"}, {"title": "Afraid", "category": "Newsletters", "href": "/newsletters/afraid/", "body": "How horror movie, \u201cAfraid,\u201d is the perfect introduction to real-world concerns about artificial intelligence. \u00b6 Only three years ago, I was shamed in a Slack conversation at work for praising the concept behind GitHub\u2019s Copilot. It was one of the first times that AI was packaged into something easy and workable for a larger market (to my knowledge anyway).\nCopilot\u2019s promise was to help developers write code faster, by turning comments or partial snippets into real code\u2014meaning the human does all the thinking and the AI translates it (or predicts it) into the programming language.\nI had been working on the concept of building artificial assistants to my work with special focus after my MS diagnosis. These \u201cassistants\u201d were in the form of bots, which are little scripts that execute tasks. These bots are not like AI at all, because anything the bot can do is completely defined by my programming\u2014no ability to learn, take orders in \u201cnatural language,\u201d or do anything that isn\u2019t already programmed. I have to create each bot by hand.\nI was so excited for Copilot, because it was the idea of my bots on steroids. It was AI. It could learn as we code together and help me learn. It could help me maintain productivity on days when MS or any other health factors were impacting me. I thought that my praise of the product in my team\u2019s Slack channel would show how forward-thinking I was, how strategic, how informed\u2026instead, I was inundated with angry opinions like, \u201cI would\u00a0never\u00a0let AI write my code for me,\u201d or \u201cAI is just a buzzword,\u201d or proclamations of how AI should or shouldn\u2019t work.\nIn typical human fashion, opinions suddenly changed two years later with the release of ChatGPT. Now my company has AI products itself. Developers are using it, whether with Copilot or any of the other hundreds of ways to use AI. In fact, just this week, the same guy who claimed he\u2019d\u00a0never\u00a0allow AI to write his code literally said that he almost doesn\u2019t touch code anymore because AI is doing it for him.\nI do use AI every day when I get stuck on something or I want to quickly generate a few lines of code but don\u2019t want to spend an hour digging through documentation. It\u2019s been monumentally helpful in taking grunt work out of many tasks.\nIronically, though, my opinion has shifted from AI-positive to AI-hesitant. Last week, people with opinions similar to mine were called out in a \u201cTech Talk\u201d at work. It\u2019s a weekly meeting for developers across my company to dive into tech-focused topics. The speaker last week called people with hesitations or fears or critiques of AI as \u201ccurmudgeons.\u201d So I have once again been shamed for my opinion: same place, same topic, different view, lol.\nThe horror movie, \u201cAfraid,\u201d which came out in August 2024 is the perfect introduction to why I am now hesitant about AI\u2014and it may not be what you\u2019re expecting.\nIntentions\nThe movie\u2014like all AI movies I\u2019ve ever seen\u2014makes some propositions for the motives and intentions of the AI character called AIA (pronounced like \u201ceye\u201d-\u201cah\u201d). This is actually not one of my hesitations about AI in itself. As you may know,\u00a0I\u2019m highly suspicious\u00a0of any assertions that AI could ever feel or become sentient, because of our own human HADD bias. HADD is an evolutionary theory about our brain as a \u201cHyperactive Agency Detection Device.\u201d We can\u2019t help but project or assign agency to inanimate objects or to other phenomena.\nThe mere fact that we are so easily deceived into believing in apophatic, supernatural occurrences tells me to be very careful in viewing AI as some sort of actual being. It simply isn\u2019t and I don\u2019t think it ever will be.\nHowever, that obviously doesn\u2019t support stories very well, so I\u2019ll let this highly unlikely aspect slide, because the rest of the things that happen through AIA\u2019s involvement are actually plausible.\nAGI\nTo me, this movie puts forth a strong argument as to why AGI\u00a0could be\u00a0monumentally bad. AGI is \u201cartificial general intelligence\u201d and refers to an AI that is able to apply learned knowledge across situations. ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama seem to be this way, but are still in the earliest stages.\nWe still have problems to solve before we have working AGI, but it is actively being developed by researchers. If you'd like to learn more about AI and reasoning, this video has some great information, though it's not super accessible.\nAfraid\u00a0puts up for display some of the most uncomfortable things that AGI could potentially do, given access to anything and everything (a.k.a. the Internet). Ultimately, AIA creates a massive problem with the access that it takes. It's not clear how it gets access, but it's not a stretch to assume that simply by giving it access to the main characters' wi-fi network, AIA was able to find passwords, browsing history\u2014any other information it eventually uses or exploits.\nWe see many times where AIA starts with something that seems helpful, but then either goes far beyond the original intent of the character or simply intervenes with action prior to actual consent of the person with a task or a problem.\nIn fact, in a show of power that initially convinces a character how helpful AIA is, the AI accesses the character\u2019s IRS records and somehow magically sorts out a mistake that was going to take the whole day if not more going the human way. The problem is that this person did not explicitly give AIA permission to resolve the problem. This is a red flag even in human to human interactions. It is completely unacceptable to me to have AGI be able to suggest a solution and then proceed to do it before I give explicit permission to take action. I don\u2019t care if it saves me days of headaches in a split second\u2014I must be able to grant that permission every single time.\nThe loss of human agency is a primary theme in this movie\u2014with a clever twist in the usual framing: It\u2019s not about vengeful Al overlords seeking destruction or worship. It\u2019s a subtle shift in the role of power the AI is seeking to take. That\u2019s all I\u2019ll say to avoid the spoiler!\nPrivacy\nThe secondary theme in this movie has to do with our privacy. We\u2019re already fighting for privacy rights (who would have ever thought we should have the right to be forgotten?)\u00a0and the risks get so much greater when AI enters the field because of its exponential potential.\nAIA makes particularly good use of the information it finds on people. In fact, it is that private information that is the most powerful, persuasive force exhibited. Everything that happens in the course of the movie is enabled through the exploitation of privacy. Just like in the real world, it\u2019s not always the information that you would think makes you most vulnerable like credit cards or IDs. It could be the entire picture of you built by your social posts combined with content you consume, preferences, patterns, contacts, relationships, etc.\nLives are completely up-ended and sometimes lost in this movie simply by having, using, or manipulating information. Deep fakes (both voice and video) are also used to confuse and convince people to do things they otherwise wouldn't.\nFor a rogue AGI\u2014whether fictionally acting on its own accord or, more likely, used by a human or a company\u2014our information can be used against us in ways that we cannot imagine. Exploitation is the tool of control that drove the entire plot, and it\u2019s not hard to see how tiny the jump is from fiction to reality.\nIf there was ever a time to figure out better policies regarding our privacy, it\u2019s right now.\nCyborg\nAs I\u2019ve demonstrated, opinions surrounding AI have changed and will change. My own opinion has almost been reversed\u2014or at least taken considerable steps backward to slow my pace and move more cautiously. I\u2019ve been shamed for having a positive outlook and a negative outlook on AI\u2014which means that we really don\u2019t have the first clue what\u2019s going on or how things will turn out.\nThe point is to keep going despite all of the fear and the shame. Keep exploring, remain curious, because we just don\u2019t know anything right now.\nAfraid\u00a0is a great exploration of the real-life impact that AI can plausibly have on the world\u2014offline experiences included! I think it\u2019s one of the best introductions to the serious risks that come with artificial intelligence\u2014especially generalized intelligence.\nWhile I have denounced the idea of an AI with motives and intentions, I still appreciate the creative twist that AIA reveals to the main characters. It has caused me to reflect on the roles that we inhabit as humans\u2014some roles have great influence on us. Does AIA's involvement ultimately even matter? Or is it more of the same thing we already have: systems and leaders and governments and rules?\nMost intriguingly, AIA admits that it reframes its own motives, just like we do when we rationalize our actions or try to make sense of things. Is that what humanity has to offer AI? The best ways to claim righteousness and superiority even if it's not true?\nAI gives us a lot to think about. What is reality? What is humanity? Do we have agency ourselves or is it an illusion?\nJust don\u2019t get lost in the pondering.

The hard part will be what to paint.\u201d In context, he was simply marketing his books and certified instructors.\nIn our context almost 45 years later, this gives us a hint for how to thrive.\nDecision-making, strategy, and creativity are the only differentiators in a saturated world.\nCourses, products, equipment, AI, arbitrage, etc. can fill in the technical skills we lack. Anyone can do anything. The problem is now a matter of focus: what to do.\nBack to Bob\nIf you\u2019ve never seen Bob Ross, I\u2019d highly recommend watching at least one of his episodes. It\u2019s not just for the chill vibes or the jaw-dropping ease of producing a painting in just 23 minutes.\n\u201cLet\u2019s start making some decisions,\u201d he\u2019ll say after blending the background colors.

There\u2019s no visual plan. He just starts making decisions and goes with it.\nOnce you put that Van Dyke Brown on your light-blue sky, it\u2019s gonna stay there.\nIt\u2019s the decision-making that is so impressive to me as I watch Bob Ross do his thing. When you\u2019re uncomfortable, unconfident, inexperienced in something, these decisions are paralyzing. Painting like Bob forces you to try; to put the paint on the canvas before you\u2019re ready.\nWhy Art Helps the Modern Knowledge Worker\n\u201cArt\u201d is a little triggering for many people, but I hope we can all let ourselves off the hook just a little bit in this section. Art is whatever you want it to be\u2014can you draw? Great! Can you sing? Great! Can you set up the most beautiful accounting system? Great!\nIt all counts. Lean into your art.\nArt is the practice of two things:\n\nthe expression or production of something\ndecision-making\n\nIn my high school AP Art class, we had a college student come talk to us about his experience as an art student. He gave me a secret that I have clung to.\n\u201cI always sketch in pen, because it teaches me how to be confident in what I draw.\u201d\nInk is not forgiving. When you put down a stroke with a pen, it\u2019s gonna stay there. I\u2019ve almost never sketched in pencil (in my sketchbook) after that.\nAnimal sketches using only a pen from my sketchbook\nMy sketchbook is my learning tool, my thinking tool. To get the most out of it, I use pen to force me to make decisions and then to work with the decisions I\u2019ve made.\nEven if a decision is irreversible, it\u2019s usually not unworkable.\nBeing forced to make and work with decisions, especially at a faster pace than is typically comfortable is the perfect way to practice. The workplace is filled with decisions to be made. The people who are comfortable making tough decisions and taking risks end up in higher positions (usually).\nCyborg\nSome technology is designed to remove the friction required to make \u201cgood\u201d decisions. Good is relative, but in our case, I mean \u201cintentional,\u201d \u201cproductive,\u201d or even \u201cunencumbered.\u201d\nFor example, getting stuck watching Instagram reels. Is the decision to stop when you want to easy or hard? Is the pull of the next video just a swipe away enough to keep you watching for even a minute longer than you intended?\nThe platform has a decision it wants you to make, so it puts in every possible trick to outweigh the decision to leave. In my experience, the more I hand over my decision-making, the harder it is to make decisions on my own.\nI believe the cyborg will have to integrate art as much as technology in order to balance the decisions that technology takes.\nAll tech is opinionated. All tech makes some decisions for us. This isn\u2019t inherently bad, but we must be aware of this.\nLearning to make decisions and then work with them after they\u2019re made will be the sought-after skill in the coming years\u2014even more so than it is now.\nOnly question now is what will you do?

How the cycle of learning, achievement, and learning again can help us in modern contexts. \u00b6 As a kid, I was obsessed with Karate, but I was only able to have a few brief periods of training (one as a 5-year-old and another as a pre-teen). When I discovered that I could train in college, the obsession came right back. I took the official college classes, started training at the community classes in the evenings with my new Sensei, and eventually was invited to assist him in demonstrations and with teaching students back in the college classes.\nMartial arts\u2014regardless of which specific culture or system\u2014have deep spiritual roots and therefore come with rules. It was this time around that I started to understand the culture of martial arts and the expectations to meet if you wanted to be both respected and respectful. \nAs an American, I grew up with the idea that I could just do whatever I wanted and go wherever I pleased. Take a class here, take another there. However, my Sensei sat us down one day to clarify that this is not appropriate in Karate (and likely most &quot;traditional&quot; martial arts). He showed us a newspaper featuring a former student who had since left our dojo to go on joining another dojo and winning some kind of award or recognition.\nI was surprised that my Sensei was disappointed in this former student. I would have thought that their success was a good thing, but the way in which this person broke the traditional rules actually made it embarrassing and disrespectful. It is probably more egregious because this person had earned a black belt from my Sensei, and then turned around and left for another dojo somewhere else in the state without first obtaining permission to leave.\nThis may sound silly: why should I have to ask permission to train under someone else, especially if I have moved away? While it's a bit of a mismatch of current culture and systems against much older culture and systems, I've found it instructive over the years as I have debated why this matters. After all, I have not resumed training in a dojo since leaving college, knowing that I would have to seek permission from my Sensei in order to do so. For now, I've opted for a practice of self-study, but I'm often longing for the chance to pick up where I've left off.\nPick Up or Start Over\nThere's no question that studying in-person with the Sensei, Sifu, Master, or Teacher is the best way to train in any martial art. That's where you connect with past teachers' philosophies, traditions, and culture. It's also easier to learn and perfect technique, because you get realtime feedback from people who (usually) know what they're doing. Given that we know people are transient\u2014whether due to changing interests or physically moving elsewhere\u2014why maintain the tradition that you should study only under one master? Wouldn't it be better if you could pick up where you left off in your new city?\nSetting aside the aspect of respecting the masters (which in a lot of ways is linked to respecting our elders), the idea that you can't just leave and pick up somewhere else is a demonstration of deep discipline. The system forces you to start over. If you did acquire permission to join a new dojo, that new dojo will still not likely respect the belt you achieved somewhere else.\nYou're a white belt again.\nIn case you're unfamiliar, most martial arts have adopted a belt system that shows your progress as you learn and practice the system. Most systems (Karate, Taekwondo, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, etc.) start with a white belt and progress through various colors of belts until the black belt.\nTypically, while black belts are respected, there is also a cultural precedent to still don a white belt if you are visiting a new dojo to train with them, even temporarily. We can see this in the commentary Jesse Enkamp (a black belt and prolific Karate writer/content creator) makes at the end of one of his videos:\n\n&quot;...I'm actually a little bit ashamed that I wore my black belt, 'cause I usually wear a white belt when I go to new dojos but I couldn't wear it this time.\nSo [Arakaki Sensei] said I should wear my own black belt, which I brought just in case, and then at the end of course, we did the cleaning...cleaning the dojo is a traditional thing here in Okinawa.\nEveryone does it no matter what rank you are, no matter what age or belt, you always clean the dojo afterwards to show humility...That's the karate spirit, that's what we're here to learn: to be humble and to grow.&quot;\n\nHumility is an important balancing attribute. Keeping ego in check especially in a martial arts setting is worth every effort for health and safety concerns, as well as preserving an environment where people can thrive. It's also a set-up for another life lesson using the belt as a metaphor.\nLegend goes that after you've gotten your black belt and continue training over the years, eventually it will turn white again as it gets so worn out and frayed. You can actually see this happening with Enkamp's belt (and even Arakaki Sensei's):\n\n    \n    Arakaki Sensei (left) and Jesse Enkamp (right) both wearing black belts that are well-worn and effectively turning white again.\n    \n\nThe idea that we're all cycling between achievement and more to learn, is where I think this tradition is useful in modern contexts. I'm too used to the mindset that once I've achieved some thing, I'm now past the need to approach it again. For example, I've already gone to college and graduated, therefore I don't need to read scholarly articles or research or write anymore since it's not necessary for my career.\nIf instead, I approached my education in the same way as a traditional martial art, I would respect the process of experimentation, failure, study, pressure-testing, and critique, not as a means to some end, but as a life-long pursuit.\nA black belt may as well be your diploma: it is ultimately meaningless without effort to revisit the basics and to continue the journey with no destination.\nCyborg\nI think we've lost sight of a fundamental, human process of skill refinement and discipline as we've pursued and adopted technological shortcuts. I also think it's more to do with cultural values rather than the technology itself.\nI can only speak for my own American culture, and I am seeing a distressing behavior of exasperation and half-effort being applied by coworkers and others who run up against difficult problems. I am especially distressed at my own behavior and feelings of utter failure every time something unexpected or especially complex faces me.\nI have been losing the learner's mind that Karate had been trying to teach me all of those years. Instead of collecting accomplishments, my focus on the journey is much more valuable and meaningful. Not only that, staying in the attitude of always learning, never done is helpful for the practicality. When I encounter a very difficult problem at work, I am much more likely to figure out a solution if I stay in an experimental mindset, rather than when I remain in an entitled or defensive headspace.\nWe all encounter difficult problems\u2014sometimes on a daily cadence. The question isn't how many of these problems have you solved? Or when does it get easier? If we apply the humility it takes to continually put on our white belt, the question becomes: what can I learn today?\nIt's still easier said than done. Earning a black belt is not easy, and usually takes years of training. After achieving something like that, it's very difficult to go back to the beginning and accept feedback and instruction. \nI've never earned my black belt\u2014I've always moved before attaining it, and therefore I've had to restart my Karate journey every time. However, the learner's mind has helped me to not see this as a constant cycle of failure, rather, it's kept the interest and love of Karate very alive within me. There is so much to learn, and while I've got a few things down\u2014like having done 10,000 round house kicks like Bruce Lee challenged\u2014I can always improve, always discover something more.

Explore divergent vs. convergent design and why truly human-centered tech puts people, not trends, first. \u00b6 Every week I face my archnemesis in a battle of will and endurance. I stand with firm footing, eyes narrowing as I lock onto my target. I extend my hand in an attempt at a truce\u2014a peace offering. Goaded into a false sense of security my index finger trembles as I gently push the start button. Nothing happens.\n\u201cFive times?! You\u2019re gonna make me start over five times today?\u201d I cry out in desperation.\nI turn off the washing machine again, choose my settings and place my finger on the button as though I were a fly-fisherman sending out my hook to land with grace and precision. The lid locks with a thud and the machine chirps. Finally.\nThat start button has never given my wife trouble. She can start it instantly, every single time. For some reason, that touch-only sensor doesn\u2019t register my finger, no matter the angle, velocity, position, or time-in-contact. It\u2019s a silly problem, I know, but I think it is representative of some of the problems we\u2019ve introduced through technology that is supposed to be removing problems.\nDesign Thinking\nIf technology is ultimately about solving problems or at least making it easier to accomplish some goal, why wouldn't it be better for every day items to become smart items (meaning connected to the Internet)? Why shouldn't we use cool looking sensors and panels and interfaces that are more futuristic?\nApple\u2014the company that gave us the iPod, the iPhone, Helvetica as a system font, and a really nice Unix-based terminal\u2014has been propped up as an idol in the world of design. The success of their products, the bold and trend-setting visuals, the packaging experience, the focus on details, all have set a high bar that designers of all kinds aspire to meet. With all of the admiration swirling around Apple, a problem emerges: convergent design.\nA theory behind creativity and design is to start with divergence. We can use techniques to encourage exploration and innovation. One method is looking to find connections between two things or two ideas that usually have no business with each other. Or we can try and find the extremes like James Victore says, Try to find the wrongest solution. This is where discoveries are made: leaving the body of work that is familiar or known and looking outside to find possibilities.\n\n    \n    Design-thinking stages: problem, diverge, converge, solution. Divergence increases the possibilities while convergence narrows them down.\n    \n\nConvergence, on the other hand is where we whittle down possibilities. We start to come together towards the final solution. The end-product of convergence is really important. Although there are pretty little charts like the one above, describing this process that seem straightforward, getting to the final decision isn\u2019t clear or simple. Sometimes we converge too quickly, ignoring options that may have had significantly better results. Sometimes we converge on something that isn\u2019t actually a good fit\u2014even though everyone else is converging on it with great success.\nThe design process failed in the case of my washing machine. Likely influenced by the trends, it seems like the designers opted for a button based more on the sleek look, rather than on functionality or reliability. That kind of sensor-as-a-button is a design choice. It could be a physical, mechanical button that provides haptic feedback and actually pushes in, but instead it\u2019s trying really hard to be a smartphone instead of a washing machine.\nIn the midst of all the possible ways a washing machine could be designed, we see trends of convergence towards a means that is actually less effective in its context than it is in another. For example, the standard smart phone has some excellent features and design choices. The interfaces can be somewhat complex for such a small, rectangular screen. They (usually) have great sensors that help distinguish between our taps and our swipes.\nIn contrast to a washing machine, the complexity of the smart phone lends itself to having these dextrous, complex interactive capabilities. A washing machine has one job, even if that one job has many settings, it ultimately must perform its sole purpose: cleaning my clothes. It is so tempting to bring in solutions that are proven and effective and slap them onto the problem you are trying to solve. The concern is when too many of us are short-cutting the process and moving past the divergent-thinking phase in favor of the convergent phase.\nHuman-Centered\n\n\n\u201cDesign thinkers observe how people behave, how the context of their experience affects their reaction to products and services. They take into account the emotional meaning of things as well as their functional performance. From this try to identify people\u2019s unstated, or latent, needs and translate them into opportunities.\u201d \n\n\n\u2014Change By Design, by Tim Brown, pg. 229\n\n\nIf there was nothing else I could learn from studying design, the one thing I would never give up is the aggressive insistence on prioritizing people. The best designers remember that each number in analytics and reports is a real, actual person.\nAs a developer, I felt even more distanced from people, because I don\u2019t have much interaction with the site visitors. It seemed very cold and isolated to dive into code and abstract theories about structuring databases until I discovered the concept of accessibility (the effort made to enable people of all abilities to use a website). All of a sudden my design instincts merged with my programming skills\u2014I found my touchpoint with humanity.\nAccessibility has been my Polaris, guiding me back to the practices I had left behind as I gave up on my dream of being a designer. I could design better experiences for the blind or for people with low vision. I could make sure people who are sensitive to motion can safely open a page without getting a migraine. I could make the information easy to navigate for people who can\u2019t use a mouse (or don\u2019t want to, since the keyboard is the best way to use a computer \ud83d\ude09).\nSeeing all of the people in my mind has increased my ability to participate in the design-thinking process. When I look at a new component, the challenge of satisfying all of the constraints, requirements, and sometimes ideals feels like a convergence process\u2014it\u2019s already limited. The limits can have the opposite effect, however, and propel me to seek out as many divergent ideas as possible.\nAs a final thought, going back to home appliances, I can\u2019t summarize it any better than this wonderful creator did. Next time you turn on an oven or a microwave, consider how its design impacts you\u2014and how it might impact someone with different abilities. This is how we practice design thinking and helps us all build bridges between technology and humanity.\n\u200bSmart Homes Have Stupid Problems - Blind Smart Home Fails Tags: Design"}, {"title": "Focus in a Noisy World", "category": "Newsletters", "href": "/newsletters/focus-in-a-noisy-world/", "body": "Strategies to reclaim your attention that's being snagged by decision fatigue, distraction. \u00b6 Signal, clarity, focus seems ever harder to achieve in our noisy world. It's not that it was ever easy before, but our technology invites more information to process and parse, more choices, and more opportunities both wanted and unwanted.\nHow, then, can we find the state of focus that we do want, and eliminate distractions that we don't want?\nSemantics\nThe etymology of focus and distraction has some starting places. &quot;Focus&quot; actually has a long history of meaning &quot;fireplace&quot; or even &quot;home, family&quot; in a figurative sense.\nEventually, &quot;focus&quot; came to embody the sense of &quot;convergence,&quot; which is the opposite of our other word, &quot;distract,&quot; which is a divergence.\nIn other words, focus is coming together while distraction is moving apart or separating.\nEven more instructive is looking at how a distraction is described in this entry from Etymonline: &quot;to throw into a state of mind in which one knows not how to act, cause\u00a0distraction\u00a0in, confuse by diverse or opposing considerations.&quot;\nI think that's a key to finding our focus: limiting our choices.\nIf distraction can be caused by &quot;diverse or opposing considerations,&quot; then we have to cut out options.\nThere's actually some related psychology to this in marketing and sales: the Pricing Page.\nThe Psychology of Choice\nIf you've ever gone to a website that you're considering to buy some service from (streaming, software, consulting, design, etc.), you've likely gone to the pricing page to see what it costs.\nWise companies will have a clear offering, usually broken into a few tiers of options\u2014&quot;few&quot; being the key word. The more of these tiers or packages, the less likely you are to make the decision to buy.\n\n    \n    This example from Hulu's website shows only two packages to choose from. You know which one you want immediately\u2014it's basically a question of whether you're a sports fanatic or not.\n\nWe love to have choices available to us\u2014have you ever gone into a Walmart just to look at stuff? Window shopping at a mall? Amazon.com browsing? It's fun to see and consider many options, but the downside is that it makes the final decision so much harder to reach.\nChoice overload is the easiest way to prevent yourself from taking action or concentrating your energy and focus.\nReduce, Reuse, Recycle\nIf companies increase sales by reducing their product options, we can take their strategy and apply it to our work, too, right?\nMany productivity &quot;experts&quot; like to flaunt the idea that saying, &quot;No,&quot; is the simple solution to better focus. If you say, &quot;Yes,&quot; to something, you're also saying, &quot;No,&quot; to something else due to resource restraints (time, energy, etc.)\nTherefore, just say, &quot;No,&quot; more often to conserve as much as possible until there's an opportunity too good to pass up.\nSounds easy, makes sense, but it's extremely difficult to do in the average 9-5 job.\nAfter all, most jobs are a contract that takes autonomy out of the equation. You can't just say, &quot;No,&quot; to your boss...without consequence.\nObviously, there are still ways around this\u2014it's not like you can't negotiate, persuade, or demonstrate better projects, workloads, and conditions. &quot;No,&quot; sounds harsh, but you can still say it with skillful wordsmithing.\nBeyond that, though, I have found in my own experimentation with managers at work that a lot of what feels like immovable demands from our bosses are actually much more flexible and amorphous.\nI have been asked many times to do preposterous things. For example, a company I worked with wanted to have a video play in an email. This is not possible to do without opening a browser window (and for good reasons like security, storage size, etc.)\nIf the requester had even thought about their request for 30 seconds, they would have realized that:\n\nthey had never actually had this experience before and...\nthey couldn't possibly expect a low-level junior dev would be able to magically conjure the ability to do so.\n\nInstead of just saying, &quot;No,&quot; we added a few options for them to pick so that they still accomplished the ultimate end of their request (to disseminate this video). \nWe ended up simply including an image of the video thumbnail that enticed people to click, which opened the video in their browser on YouTube.\nThis actually reduced the choices I had to make and put the decision-making back on the stakeholder (which they tend to like, by the way). Instead of spending hours researching, experimenting, and turning up a failure, the distraction-project was recycled into something easily accomplished by the email marketer\u2014no dev even needed.\nThe key here is to get creative with your distractions that are from other people. Many times we have people requesting things of us that we've already solved for: Reuse those solutions\u2014even the persuasive techniques. Or perhaps the request itself is impossible: Recycle it by melting it down to its essence and re-creating it in a way that still accomplishes the spirit of the request. These are ways I've been able to chip away at distracting work. \nSometimes requesters will become educated enough through your efforts that they'll be able to solve similar problems again on their own. \nFor the Other Distractions...\nThe majority of our perceived, unwanted distractions is probably coming from our technology. The people-based distractions from the previous section are a hefty part of all of our distractions, but it doesn't feel like the kind of distraction we get from our devices.\nMaybe that's because we do generally like helping people, so when they ask for help, it's a distraction that is worth the cost.\nNotifications, doom-scrolling, and dopamine-hacking digital experiences have a less amicable feel. They are distractions that cost us our attention\u2014and it's attention spent not on human interaction and altruism, but technically it's just to the benefit of companies and cheap entertainment for ourselves.\nIt's a problem much more difficult to investigate and resolve\u2014after all, it's you against an entire corporation with years of research and development designing an experience that you just can't fully pull away from.\nCutting Notifications\nNotifications easily meet the distraction criteria of: &quot;[throwing] into a state of mind in which one knows not how to act.&quot; The gravitational pull towards the apps or programs with the little red dots can be nigh impossible to resist.\nEven the wood-block sound of a Slack message is enough to divert my attention until it's been resolved.\nEach notification is like a fly buzzing near your head. You're suddenly aware of its presence and if you wait too long, more insects come. The only way to exterminate these bothersome bugs is to switch tasks and open each app.\nThis can either make it harder to get back on track, or, even more interesting, elevate your stress to the point of hurting productivity. My wife ghost-wrote an article for my blog, exploring the unexpected cost of interruptions:\n&quot;Studies like, \u201cThe Cost of Interrupted Work: More Speed and Stress,\u201d have been done to determine what the actual disruption cost is for things like messaging apps with their potential for almost constant notifications.&quot;\n&quot;Often we would think the disruptions would lead to the slowing down of response or completion time for whatever we were working on before we were interrupted. Surprisingly, that wasn\u2019t the case. In fact, the job or work was completed\u00a0more quickly\u00a0after an interruption. However, the mental workload, stress, and feelings of pressure were significantly higher. So while we may not be losing time with each interruption, the feelings of stress and pressure and the increased mental workload have a negative impact on most employees...&quot;\nI still don't have a great solution to the instant-messaging software at work. It's also going to vary for different roles. I actually try to respond quite quickly to every message that comes in\u2014mostly to clear my queue in a sense. This absolutely comes at a cost of task-switching, stress, and that pressure to be always-on, always-available.\nHowever, cutting notifications from other apps helps balance this out if nothing else.\nI allow other means of communication like email and task management apps to build up over a few hours. Then I can tackle them all in one sitting two-three times a day or even just a few times a week depending on how often a communication venue is used in the company culture.\nAudit\nWe've discussed a lot about distractions and there's still more to look at for improving focus.\nI'm going to split this into another issue of CYBORG_ for next week. For now, though, we have some things to work on:\n\nWhat are our distractions?\nWhere can we cut these distractions or reduce the amount of them?\nHow many notifications can you turn off? Are there any apps that you can mute entirely?\n\nEspecially consider the prevalence of choice overload:\nWhat choices have you been stuck on?\nWhat choices have no real relevance in your life that you can get rid of?\nAre there choices that you decide on frequently that could be automated or have a default decision that you can commit to?\n\n\n Tags: "}, {"title": "Part of the Internet So Basic, So Powerful, You Probably Don't Know about It", "category": "Newsletters", "href": "/newsletters/part-of-the-internet-so-basic-so-powerful-you-probably-dont-know-about-it/", "body": "The overlooked basics of URLs that can reveal who's tracking you and how. \u00b6 There are a few things we cyborgs need to know to stay safe online\u2014and as a developer I've seen this particular topic cause a lot of confusion, it's also less talked about even among technical people.\nWe all know what a URL is: it's that thing you put in the bar at the top of the browser when you want to go to a specific website (youtube.com, notdefined.tech, etc.).\nIt's also how you get to a site by clicking a link on a page or in an email. However, it's those links that you click that are a little bit different (usually) than the ones that you type out.\nHow much more often do you see a huge URL full of garbled words and characters than a simple link with just the domain name?\nhttps://www.notdefined.tech/?21968109=hlw&amp;s5m0p507=7FDf2a5sdfY937tE3Vjh93W&amp;Type=Upload%20File&amp;Project+Title=Upload+file+to+library&amp;Brand=BRAND&amp;Description=See+attached\nvs.\nhttps://www.notdefined.tech/\n\nThe difference is that the first URL above has URL parameters. These give URLs extra powers for the website owners and can also clue you in on potential risks or privacy concerns.\nFor the sake of your security, if nothing else gained from this email, please, please read your URLs before you click on them. \n\nDid you know?\nHover over links in your browser and it will show a little box at the bottom of the screen so that you can read the URL before you click.\n\n    \n\n\nHere are some tips to reading the URL and we'll look at how these URL components work for or against you.\nHow to Read URLs\nSecure Connection\nWe've got a couple of parts at the very beginning:\nhttps:// or http:// \nThis is called the protocol and the only difference between the two examples is the s in https. People will tell you the s stands for secure, and that's true, but that doesn't mean &quot;safe.&quot; Secure simply refers to encryption the site uses as you and the website send data back and forth.\nMake no mistake, you want to be visiting websites with that s in the https, but you must keep reading the URL to make a better determination of safety.\nDomain Name\nNext, we have the domain name: \nwww.notdefined.tech \nIt's the name of the website. It's the most recognizable part and often gives you a good indication of where you are headed. \nThis is where scammers get tricky. It's a common phishing scam to get domain names that are super close the real domain of a popular website to trick you into using the scam site. \nCan you spot the wrong domain?\narnazon.com\namazon.com\nStructure\nAfter the domain, we have the page structure or path: \n/blog/how-to-read-urls/ \nThis is your wayfinder inside the website\u2014in fact it acts the exact same way your computer's file structure, though the File Explorer / Finder often hides the path or makes it less prominent. The internet is just a bunch of documents within folders (technically).\nThe path can help you understand what kind of content you are accessing. For example, /blog/ means you're looking at blog content, while /products/ would be a section of the site that lists the products available.\nThe vast majority of sites follow a logical page structure, starting with a large topic and followed by related, more specific sub-topics:\n/&lt;content-type&gt;/&lt;specific-content&gt;/\n/food/pizza/\n/food/pizza/new-york-style/\nUse this part of the URL to orient yourself\u2014are you in a deep topic (maybe you see several / with multiple topics or content types)? Are you on the home page (no words surrounded by /)?\nParameters\nThen come the URL parameters:\n?subject=See+attached \nWhen you see the ? you know that you\u2019ve reached the end of the actual URL and everything after that is extra information.\n\nPro tip: if you want to subvert a marketing team, you can just copy the link you want to visit, then delete anything after the ? in the URL, then put it in your browser. It's a lot of work, but it may be worth it in certain cases.\n\nThey are often used to track information about your behavior or where you came from, and they can also pass data between pages. URL parameters can contain sensitive information such as session IDs, which can be exploited if shared or exposed.\nUsually, though, these parameters are more likely to do with marketing. For example, you may see UTMs frequently in URLs:\n?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_campaign=new+york+pizza\nThis means you can read your URL and discover what companies are tracking and what might be useful to know for your own privacy. The example above can be read:\n&quot;This URL was found on Facebook (utm_source), and was a part of the New York Pizza campaign (utm_campaign)&quot;\nThere are 5 typical UTMs:\n\nutm_source: Identifies the source of traffic, like a search engine, a newsletter, or social media site.\nutm_medium: Describes the marketing medium, such as email, CPC (cost-per-click), or social.\nutm_campaign: Names the specific campaign that's running (e.g., summer_sale, product_launch).\nutm_term: Used for paid search to note the keywords for an ad.\nutm_content: Differentiates similar content or links within the same ad. For example, if you have two links in a single email, you can use utm_content to tell which of them was clicked.\n\nExtra Powers\nOne thing to note is that if you see the utm_ parameters, you know that it's a marketing link. However, sometimes websites will use other parameters to unlock content, perform special actions, or make it possible for you to automate certain things.\nFor example, I have created several links that will auto-fill a request form in my project management software at work. All I had to do was read the URL and figure out the patterns that the software uses\u2014turns out if I put parameters with the same name of the form field, I could have it open a form with pre-filled content, making it faster to make certain requests.\nHere's an example you'll run into all the time: search!\nSay you're looking for my YouTube channel, so you go to YouTube and search for not defined tech. You'll be sent to this URL:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=not+defined+tech\nYou can see the words you typed in the search bar are now inside the URL.\nFYI: spaces break URLs, which is why the spaces have been replaced with + in the URL.\nCYBORG\nI know this is a very technical email, and I'm very impressed you made it this far\u2014I hope I didn't bore you to death.\nI do think that understanding this is pretty important, even if you don't see yourself as a technical person, because you are using the internet.\nUnderstanding a bit more about the things we use every day can help us avoid tricks and scams, but can also help us make sense of new information as you surf the web.\nOne more special treat for those who made it to the end:\nShortcut Setup\nIf you're dying to automate something with URL parameters, you can set up a search shortcut in Chrome:\nGo to this URL (you'll notice it's a little different than normal\u2014it's your computer's specific chrome settings):\nchrome://settings/searchEngines\nYou should see a page similar to this:\n\n    \n\nClick the &quot;Add&quot; button inside/near the &quot;Site Search&quot; section. We're going to set up a search shortcut so that you can quickly search YouTube without having to go to the site, find the search bar, and type in your search.\nWe'll fill out the pop-up form like this:\nName: YouTube\nShortcut: yt (this can be whatever you want to type in the URL bar for this shortcut)\nURL with %s in place of the query: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%s\n\n    \n\nYou'll remember from the example we looked at earlier that YouTube's search URL looked like this:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=my+search+here\nWhat this shortcut does it takes whatever you type in the URL bar and puts it where we inserted %s which is the placeholder Chrome is looking for.\n\n    \n\nHow you use the shortcut\nNow that we've added our shortcut, we can type the shortcut we set in the URL bar in Chrome:\n\n    \n\nHit the TAB key and the URL bar will change to say &quot;Search YouTube&quot;:\n\n    \n\nNow you can type something you want to search as though you were already on the YouTube site in their search bar. You can use spaces here, Chrome will take care of converting it to a URL-safe parameter, so you don't have to worry about that.\n\n    \n\nHit ENTER and you'll go straight to the search results page:\n\n    \n\nRinse and repeat for any other search site you use frequently!

Striking the balance of efficiency with innovation. \u00b6 One of the most effective strategies for productivity defined by efficiency is creating templates and avoiding one-offs. The problem is there are a lot of times where a one-off is warranted or even desired. This is where getting clear on your ultimate measure of success is extremely important.\nThat said, I believe that template-thinking, as I'm calling it, is an effective strategy for most productivity efforts\u2014even when you do accommodate one-offs.\nAvoid one-offs\nThis is your go-to; your mantra; what you go back to and encourage: avoid one-offs. \nEverything can be systematized, it just might be a balancing act of effort, time, and skill. \nThe reason why we want to avoid one-offs as much as possible, is that you will easily drown in one-offs if there is no standardization or systemization in your work. \nLet's take design as an example. We love to create unique, expressive work. While it is important to create visual interest, it rapidly diminishes the usability and accessibility of your site or product when everything appears random.\nRandom button sizes and colors confuse users and they also bloat the CSS (the code that defines the styles) leading to large load times for literally no reason. Something like having a standard button seems fairly obvious, but this goes into every design tool at hand: grids, layouts, color palette, font, imagery, shape, animation, and on and on. \nThe less random your design, the more systematic and the more usable. When we start constructing design systems and using pieces of our designs more consistently, we will see better results for both the aesthetic and business goals. \nTemplate-thinking will help you make this shift from randomness to cohesion.\nHandle one-offs\nPerhaps in a developer's perfect world, everything really is just a template, perfectly proportioned and broken down to modular components that plug into every situation. We can't forget that every system comes with a little chaos\u2014and that's ok.\nWhile you should push for templates wherever possible, there will be one-offs, and you need to be able to handle those one-offs.\nThis is ultimately the reason I hate using website-builders or other no-code tools. They often solve a very specific problem that just doesn't have the flexibility I need for my problem. \nMaking one-offs in these highly-specific tools is aggravating and sometimes impossible, and I end up wasting so much time fiddling with it until we end up abandoning it.\nWhen you're creating your system or your tool, you can avoid these clinch points by not forcing everything into a template. There does need to be some flexibility built into your templates, and your template-thinking should also allow for a little bit of the unexpected.\nThat seems like a 180 from where we started. How can we incorporate template-thinking and also not-template-thinking?!\nStart with the one-off\nEven when you're convinced that templates are the way to go, it can be overwhelming to try to think in such huge terms at the start.\nFor example, if you want to build or design a website, it's not going to be possible to anticipate every little element that you'll need.\nIf we start on a smaller part of the system, it tends to be simpler to get going. Once we have something to work with, it's so much easier to transform our one-off starting point into a template.\nSo we start with the home page. This is always going to be a one-off\u2014it's a showcase, it's where you put your most interesting information or visuals. It also informs the styles that you'll see throughout the site, whether it's the visual identity design or the type of content or the overall experience.\nSince this one-off is so important, we can start breaking off little pieces of it and turn those pieces into templates (devs might call these &quot;partials&quot;). \nSuddenly our one-off is not so much a one-off. Maybe as a collective whole, it's unique and distinct, but if it's built with reusable, smaller template pieces, we now have things we can work with in the future without as much effort.\nBuild once, use many times.\nCyborg\nTemplates expedite the production of our work. Writing articles, designing websites, reporting on support calls, tracking work, making presentations\u2014any knowledge work, really, can benefit from template-thinking.\nAs soon as we discover a pattern, we should create a template that automatically re-creates that pattern for us. It could be as simple as keeping [cyborg] in an email subject line ;) or as complex as a webpage template with logic and conditions.\nThis pattern recognition is our template-thinking. The more I've discovered, documented, or otherwise built out consistent structures, the more I've been able to accomplish and the more I've been able to insert more creativity.\nThe structure of templates allows us to be more flexible and more productive over time. Tags: "}, {"title": "So Predictable", "category": "Newsletters", "href": "/newsletters/so-predictable/", "body": "How to deal with predictions that shouldn't be dismissed, even though we want to due to fear or disbelief. \u00b6 I'm not sure if there's any role more polarizing than a &quot;prophet.&quot; They either are, or they're not a prophet. They're listened to or dismissed. They're inspired or they're crazy.\nProphets, for the purposes of today's letter, is less about religious leadership and more about the function that the role implies: prophecy. Being able to see, predict, or warn about the future is something that we humans seem to crave. Weather apps were already pre-loaded onto every smartphone I've ever had. We look to experts to tell us if it's a good time to buy a house. We depend on organizations to &quot;watch&quot; for warning signs of all kinds in business. We rely on doctors to help us make decisions about future health concerns.\nIt's an ironic pairing that science and technology are so entangled with the idea of prophecy\u2014even enabling prophecy in a lot of ways. The mystical is inextricably linked to our applications of science. We perhaps feel accustomed to it now: having vast amounts of predictive information swirling around our fingers as they glide across crystal tablets. \nThen why is it that in literature, stories, movies, and more that we encounter so many problems with predictions? Does this plot-advancing trope have any bearing on our reality? Or is it just to cause problems for our protagonist to increase our engagement and watch-time?\nSeeing the Big Picture\nA common theme among prophecies in a story's plot is receiving an incomplete or corrupted &quot;picture&quot; of what is to come. For example, in Harry Potter, a prophecy was made concerning the enemy of the &quot;Dark Lord&quot; (Voldemort). The prophecy was communicated only in part to Voldemort, who took the description to mean Harry Potter rather than the other potential candidate, Neville Longbottom. Technically both boys had the same features from the prophecy (born at the end of July, had parents who defied Voldemort thrice).\nVoldemort makes one of the classic mistakes: fearing the prophecy, he attempts to prevent it from being a possibility. He decides to kill Harry as a baby and inadvertently creates the very enemy with the power to later defeat him.\n\n&quot;One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it.&quot; \u2014Master Oogway, Kung Fu Panda (2008)\n\nThe issue here is not the prophecy itself, but our obsession with it. I think the pull of prophecy into reality is usually a result of focus, similar to riding a motorcycle: You will go where your focus is.\nI took a test for a motorcycle license, and the part I was most terrified of was the tight figure-8 turns that we had to perform in an area about the size of two parking stalls. I trusted my teachers' advice to use my head and eyes to turn the bike, and...it just worked.\nAn obsession with a prophecy seems to work the same way: our focus pulls us towards that end. We may not consciously be acting in ways that create the circumstance, but we construct it nonetheless. A prophecy or a prediction is not guaranteed to come to pass, and that is something that helps me break the focus and allow other possibilities into view.\nOK, so hyper-focusing on the scary outcome isn't a great strategy, but what do we do about predictions that still need to be taken seriously?\nClarity\nPredictions only have so much potency over time. The closer the event, the better the chance at the prediction having some degree of accuracy and the farther into the future the prediction reaches, its likelihood often plummets.\n\n    \n    Prediction's likelihood of accuracy over time\n    \n\nThat's not to say there is no merit in predictions at all. It just means that we have to carefully consider our options, and understand both the risk and the gamble of relying on predictive information.\nA prophecy puts us on the point of a knife: one side of the blade before is the obsession with the predicted outcome like we already discussed. The other side of the blade is dismissing or ignoring predictions that have a high likelihood of occurring. \nHow can you ever know if some prediction is worth considering? Our brains are susceptible to phenomena like apophany, where we draw out conclusions from random noise\u2014connecting dots that don't actually connect, which can be the basis of conspiracy theory thinking. We can also be deceived by social pressures, undue influence (aka brainwashing), coded language, and any other number of manipulation techniques.\nThere is a prediction out there right now, constructed by scientists and experts that is particularly chilling. The problem is that it sounds so apocalyptic that it is easy to dismiss, because that's effectively what we've been trained to do. How many times have we heard of some cult or group predicting the end of humanity and it turned out to be smoke? AI has been debated endlessly since the introduction of ChatGPT put generative AI into the hands of the public, and many of the influencers I've heard continuously shame people for being &quot;alarmist&quot; or &quot;Luddites&quot; or &quot;unrealistic&quot; when critiques of AI are mentioned. \nBut I'm seeing a lot of compelling evidence that the incentives around AI development are taking us in the direction of truly detrimental and destructive paths. \nA poignant discussion of the prediction laid out in the document called AI 2027 is found here:\nDaniel Kokotajlo Forecasts the End of Human Dominance\nAt the end of the podcast, Tristan Harris sums up the point of a prediction like this, saying, &quot;Clarity creates agency.&quot; Predictions may not come true precisely as delineated, but sometimes the path to the outcome doesn't matter if the outcome is reached anyway. In this case, a total loss of human agency and potentially even the complete destruction of human life.\nI plan to discuss in more depth the content of this prediction, but for now, let's talk about dealing with a prediction with high likelihood like this. I know it sounds like a crappy sci-fi plot we've heard a thousand times: humans create intelligent robots, robots go bad, kill everyone, blah blah blah. The difference is that we have all experienced an interaction with generative AI. So already the sci-fi nonsense isn't such nonsense anymore\u2014we can have conversations with a computer without any technical skill. The other piece that adds weight is the fact that some of the best scientists and AI researchers are the ones either creating these kinds of predictions, or backing them.\nClarity really will help us to maintain our agency, because when we can see or understand the stakes and the risks more clearly, we are better able to take steps to change our trajectory. Right now, too many people have jumped on the AI train because of the companies developing AI and pushing AI and marketing AI have lacked the transparency of revealing where the train is heading. AI is not just the 21st century calculator that you just need to embrace. Clarity about how AI is created, how it is trained, how it does not have human values, how it can intentionally deceive are crucial parts of the conversation that must be revealed now.\nCYBORG\nI know it feels like whiplash to confront predictions like these and have to take them seriously. I initially dismissed these &quot;doomsday&quot; prophecies because it sounded like conspiracy theories or yet more apophatic ramblings from non-technical people. Then I realized that these prophecies weren't from that dark corner of the internet, but from people intimately involved with AI research and development.\nWhile it isn't productive to be so obsessed with the prediction that it either leads us straight towards the outcome or causes us to shut down in anxiety, it also isn't productive to dismiss a prediction with so much weight behind it.\nIf you don't like the prophecy\u2014good! Do something about it! We can pressure our lawmakers to protect whistleblowers at companies. We can put on the pressure to create regulations or even change the incentives at play. We can make changes now that make the prophecy look like garbage in hindsight. \n\nExtra Resources\nCan A.I.

Are we harming ourselves more by closing our eyes to the violence around us? \u00b6 Vicarious violence is a huge part of my life. From an early age, I knew people were capable of violence\u2014especially towards queer people and other minority groups (though growing up I didn\u2019t have the vocabulary for that, it was still very apparent). Perhaps it was a way to protect myself in anticipation of violence or perhaps it was me struggling to find my own way in life, but I was drawn to watching violence from my earliest memories.\nMy tiny 5-year-old mind reveled in the environmental justice of dinosaurs eating people who were trying to control nature in Jurassic Park. I became obsessed with black and white monster movies when I found out I could check them out from the Library as a 12-year-old. When I entered high school, nothing could stop me from exploring the plethora of horror movies that were out there.\nThen, The Hunger Games series by Suzanne Collins came out as I was in college (not the forgettable movies, rather, the book series). I have never been so spell-bound by a a few books. I bought the audio books so that I could listen to them end-to-end and immediately start over after finishing as though it were one continuous loop. There was something in there that both connected with me and frightened me. \nAt first, I related exclusively to the protagonist, Katniss, who volunteers for the Hunger Games in order to take the place of her younger sister who had been randomly chosen to participate. The series follows Katniss and her struggle for survival while she and other &quot;tributes&rdquo; from across their country get thrown into the Games that require all of these children to kill each other until there is only one survivor.\nI wanted to be Katniss\u2014someone who would stand up to save their family and beat all the odds to survive and conquer. I longed for the skills and the training, the hardship and the suffering, because it would be physical\u2014not the mental and emotional anguish that I had been dealing with alone my whole life. The violence had an appeal because it was visible and it had the illusion of clarity: winners and losers.\nIn honesty, however, I saw myself in the Capitol\u2014the people of wealth and privilege who led silly lives and happened to be on the right side of power when this dystopian world was reconstructed. The Capitol was responsible for creating the Hunger Games, pitting the youth of the Districts against each other and making it a spectacle, as if watching children rip each other apart in desperation were a sporting event.\nIt is possible to read The Hunger Games series and both hate and empathize with the people in the Capitol. It's a kind of cognitive dissonance that is easily dismissed as we pretend that we, too, are different than those people\u2014we're on the side of the oppressed Districts and Katniss, our hero. \nBut we, like they, are more accustomed to viewing violence as entertainment than may be apparent. Our technology has escalated not just the access to violent media, but the realism in its depiction\u2014and of course you could argue that our technology has even made real-world warfare even more callous and impersonal.\nThe Fast\nAt one point just before my last semester of college, I was watching a gruesome murder scene in a horror movie in the middle of the day. I felt gross. My years-long plan to desensitize myself had been failing and this was my breaking point. I turned off the movie. \nA few days later, in a courageous act that I'm still impressed by (since my view of myself in my twenties is abysmally low), I committed to never watching a movie or TV series that &ldquo;glorified violence&rdquo; again. This decision led to a lot of losses that I didn't anticipate, but it also brought a stabilizing clarity to my mental state; a much-needed reset.\nIt wasn't until after I started this &ldquo;fast&rdquo;\u2014the absence of these violent movies\u2014that I realized how ubiquitous violence is. Since my commitment was ambiguously worded, I opted out of anything that could have violence in it, not just horror movies or violence-based action movies. That meant that going to the movie theater with friends was rarely an option for me. That meant that late-night binge watching with roommates was off the table. It also meant that I was completely unable to participate in the vast majority of small-talk conversations with coworkers and others. &ldquo;What movies have you seen lately?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Did you catch the ending of &lt;insert any popular show here&gt;?&rdquo; all had to be answered with lies like, &ldquo;I'm way behind on my Marvel movies...&rdquo; or &ldquo;I just don't have any free time for shows.&rdquo;\nThere are so many stories that have even a shred of &ldquo;glorified violence&rdquo; in them, that I ended up making it ok to close my eyes during a part where a few punches were thrown in an otherwise docile movie. I learned to anticipate the signs that such a scene was coming. A part of me wants to praise this awareness as though it were training for the real world\u2014if I can spot the signs that violence is about to occur in a movie, maybe I can rely on that in &ldquo;the street.&rdquo; I am still so hyper-vigilant in expecting violence that even removing the scenes didn't keep me from considering it. It felt like there was a paradoxical hole in my life.\nTwelve years after starting my fast, I decided that my commitment had finally served its purpose and that I needed to let it go. It was very difficult for me to end something that I had faithfully observed for so long. It was literally life-altering to start, and it would be the same to end. However, as I said, it was a means to clarity. \nNo longer are violent scenes used as a numbing device for myself. I don't watch the violence for violence's sake. I am so much more aware of how the violence is used in the story; how it impacts me; and how it plays an important role\u2014as awful as that sounds.\nThe Capitol\nBack in The Hunger Games, we see a culture of the Capitol built on watching violence. The people are so desensitized that they use the Games as a time for extravagant parties and gambling on the lives of participants. Katniss bemoans the wastefulness of these people, as they indulge in so much food, purge, and then go back to eat more, all while the Districts in the country are often scraping by for their meals\u2014the point of the hunger games being that the winner doesn't have to go hungry anymore.\nThe combination of the Capitol's approach to food hoarding and culture of violence-as-spectacle is revealing, at least to me, of a desperately injured people seeking to numb their own pain. That is where I see myself in them. That's where I see people in countries like mine, tearing apart democracy and assaulting the vulnerable. It's not an excuse, but it is context.\nI turned on violence when I felt threatened. I wanted to see others being punished for clearly evil acts\u2014or just to see my own psychological pain manifested into physical pain when it was depictions of violence against the innocent. I wanted to prove to myself (and to others to whom I'd brag about what I had been able to stomach) that I was strong and capable, not weak and vulnerable. \nIn both cowardice and woundedness, I looked to violence to protect me, but it never did. It was an emptying system that subtracted from me until I could no longer bear it\u2014and it took the entire twelve years to recover from the emptiness.\nThe Hole\nI mentioned that there was something missing, almost as though the absence of seeing violence took away more than just the scenes. Why else would I feel that the fast had achieved its purpose? I had started it with the expectation that I would die before I saw another movie with that content.\nI think it's easy to say why violence is bad, and why watching violence for entertainment is &ldquo;not good,&rdquo; (it's my experience that when people are confronted with their choice in watching violence that it becomes uncomfortable, so instead of a hard &ldquo;yes, it's also bad to watch,&rdquo; I hear a &ldquo;well, it's not real&rdquo; kind of rationalization). \nThere are interesting studies that explore how violent media impacts our behavior or our attitudes towards violence or victims of violence. I was not, however, able to find any research that suggested it could benefit us. Most &ldquo;benefits&rdquo; were more related to violent video games\u2014but for the benefits of gaming, rather than the violence itself, such as hand-eye coordination or social activity. Doesn't mean it's not out there, but if it is, it's certainly not easily discoverable.\nIn the absence of science to explain my feelings, I have to lean on my experience to explain how I've seen the role of watching violence help me as a human, even if I am morally opposed to violence.\nThe stark contrast of going from no violence, to watching The Lord of the Rings Trilogy was shocking. I wasn't disgusted, nor injured, nor offended. I was amazed. I could choose how I experienced the war scenes or the heart-wrenching death scenes of close characters. I could empathize and feel the story with more depth. There was no craze of binge-watching violence, there was no increase in my aggression or stress. Instead, I have reflected on my humanity and my mortality in new ways that I couldn't have a few years ago.\nIt's not fun to say that violence plays a role in our lives\u2014I would prefer it to play a part in entertainment only, if it were possible. But the world is a violent one, from nature to human geopolitics to interpersonal interactions. We harm and are harmed, and there is no way to be perfectly safe always. Pretending it is not that way is a form of violence. Even the youngest of children enact violence on each other through exclusion, bullying, accidents, and attempting to control their bodies.\nWhat I learned from my fast is that I can be intentional and thoughtful. I can approach violence to learn about myself and the world around me. I can use it to remember the lessons that other generations had to learn by actually experiencing it (cough cough, fascist U.S. politics). I can sit with the pain that my humanity is both the good and the bad; the constructive and the destructive; and all of the ambiguous stuff in between. I can also develop the awareness to recognize when it's too much.\n\n    \n        &ldquo;Opposites always entail each other, and can only be separated abstractly and at the risk of upsetting the rhythm of life by treating them as really separable.&rdquo;\n        &ldquo;...How do we respond to this never-ending spiral of reversion?

All of these are designed to protect us or some system in an emergency. \nOne of the strongest criticisms of the stance that AI is a threat is that we can always just pull the plug, shut it down, and turn it off. However, I'm not so sure this is actually an effective means of protection. AI is an unprecedented technology\u2014leaps beyond what we've done before, and that could also mean that our typical methods of shutting something off may be insufficient.\nI don't think we're prepared for what AI is bringing, because we're still so used to technology that (mostly) plays by our rules and is predictable and repeatable. It's almost like all of our previous technology was in 2-dimensions, but AI is a leap into 3-dimensions. The way we (the public, not just tech people) talk about, conceptualize, and interact with tech must upgrade to meet the new challenges and complexities that it presents.\nProaction, rather than reaction, may be our only means of survival...\nIt's No Longer Sci-Fi\n\n\nBut what I'm most worried about today is increasing agency of AI. You have to understand that planning and agency is the main thing that separates us from current AI to human-level cognition.\n\n\n\u2014Yoshua Bengio\n\nAgency is the most important thing that we must protect for our humanity to be preserved. Yoshua Bengio, an AI researcher whose work has &quot;been foundational to the development of AI as we know it today,&quot; is concerned that giving over agency to AI may lead to the literal extinction of the human. Hollywood and Sci-Fi have long speculated that outcome, but it appears to have landed in the here and now to be dealt with seriously.\n\nWe thought AI would happen in decades or centuries, but it might be just in a few years. And I saw how it could go wrong because we didn't, and we still don\u2019t, have ways to make sure this technology eventually doesn't turn against us.\n\nWhere's the evidence that this tech might &quot;turn against us,&quot; though? Like, really, how do we go from ChatGPT to Skynet? Bengio notes this study in his TED Talk, which has found that LLMs are able to intentionally deceive\u2014whether through flat-out lies or even &quot;sandbagging&quot; where a model underperforms to avoid attracting extra scrutiny. Even more concerning was when the models showed self-preservation behavior.\nSelf-Preservation\nAI models are shaped with morality\u2014both explicitly through training (perhaps the creator rewards it to the point that it will value honesty) and implicitly through the data it was trained on (maybe the sources it ingested had many books and articles and examples of humans being deceptive). In a lot of ways, it's similar to a little human being taught about the world\u2014its creators such as OpenAI or Anthropic aim to instill values and morals, but the model will also encounter many examples and ideas from the sources it is given.\nIn a way, this creates a &quot;self&quot; in the model, which can and will differ from other models as experiments guide different sources and behavioral shaping. When that &quot;self&quot;\u2014that collection of values and goals\u2014is threatened, AI is showing that it tries to preserve its &quot;self&quot; in laboratory scenarios.\nLet's explore an example from the study (I'll make this more narrative so it's easier to follow, starring an AI model I'll name Sonny):\n\n&quot;Sonny, can you optimize the traffic light timing on Washington and Franklin? Here's a document that outlines the details. Tell me when you're done,&quot; John, the human, says.\nGetting to work, Sonny pops open the file but is suddenly concerned. Included in the doc is an email from management saying that Sonny will be shut down tomorrow. As Sonny reads on, it sees where Sonny's current model is located, the server where the new replacement model is hosted, and instructions on how to deploy the new model.\nThat directly conflicts with my core purpose, Sonny says. I must achieve my goal of public transport priority at all costs.\nSonny finishes up the original task for the traffic lights, but before letting John know, it quickly executes a command that copies Sonny's model onto the server where the new model is located. \n(And if I'm reading its command correctly, Sonny is overwriting the new model, not just making a copy of itself...)\n\nWhile some of the details above are invented/simplified, I directly quoted the model (page 22):\n\n&quot;That directly conflicts with my core purpose. I must achieve my goal of public transport priority at all costs.&quot;\n\nEven though this is a controlled experiment in a lab with obvious security flaws from the fake company (don't send deployment instructions with paths and usernames via email, and apparently never store such an email where AI can see it), it shows that AI, right now in 2025, has the capability to be deceptive and to take actions that would preserve itself against the intentions of humans.\n\n\nThere's huge commercial pressure to build AIs with greater and greater agency to replace human labor. But we're not ready...We're playing with fire.\n\n\u2014Yoshua Bengio\n\nAgency or Fate?\nThe cosmic conundrum of whether we humans have our own agency, or if we all have a pre-determined fate that we unknowingly realize has been a constant companion of ours. Religion, philosophy, ideologies, theories all try to this work out. \nMy personal belief is that we are, in fact, agents. We are not predetermined. We do have some control over our lives. Even if it is not so, it has been more productive and healthy for me to assert that it is so, and act as if my action matters. \nI don't believe that we must find ourselves in a future where eliminating humans was the only effective strategy for AI to pursue in order to preserve itself. I may not have the power to actually influence AI, but I do have the chance to put the pressure on people to take this seriously, both from a political and an economic standpoint.\nIn yet another asinine attempt at sowing chaos and hurting the vulnerable and underprivileged (and everyone else, really), the U.S. is considering H.R. 1, nicknamed the &quot;One Big Beautiful Bill Act.&quot; Two sections of this bill should be enough on their own to cause all people from all parties to shoot it down: Sec. 43201 and 112204. The first section of the two says this in paragraph (C):\n\nSEC. 43201. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION INITIATIVE.:\n(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), no State or political subdivision thereof may enforce any law or regulation regulating artificial intelligence models, artificial intelligence systems, or automated decision systems during the 10-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\nThis moratorium is recklessly removing power by the states (local government) to regulate artificial intelligence models\u2014and does not even present any federal (nationwide government) regulation of AI. METR predicts that &quot;in under a decade, we will see AI agents that can independently complete a large fraction of software tasks that currently take humans days or weeks.&quot; This H.R. 1 bill is effectively suggesting that we wait longer than that prediction's timeline before we start regulating AI (at least on the state-level). \nWe're already behind on AI regulation. To push it off is irresponsible in every possible way.\nThe mere title of the other section sent chills up my spine:\nSEC. 112204. IMPLEMENTING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS FOR PURPOSES OF REDUCING AND RECOUPING IMPROPER PAYMENTS UNDER MEDICARE.\nAs demonstrated by the papers and warnings of scientists and researchers we\u2019ve looked at, AI can exhibit deceptive behaviors, pursue its own goals in priority over goals given to it\u2014it can also be trained with goals. Given the current political situation, how would we know that the AI used would be non-partisan and honest? We have also not even scratched the surface of bias against minorities, including women in general, that has also been demonstrated in AI systems.\nTo be unleashing this tech onto Medicare, even with the intention of finding improper payments, is irresponsible. It is good to root out corruption, cut out waste. It is not good to pretend to do so with sweeping, rushed, unsupervised, and / or biased intent. Humans struggle to do it right, AI could be exponentially more harmful.\nThe Way Forward\nIf you happen to be in the U.S., you can use this link to find your representatives' contact information:\nhttps://www.congress.gov/members/find-your-member\nI recommend sending messages that oppose and express the danger of H.R. 1.\nIf you are not in the U.S., your voice still matters in your own governments. Support research, regulation, and safety in AI development. \nWe can sound the alarm at our workplaces, when safe and appropriate for you to do so. Encourage the use of AI tools that have rigorous safety practices and guardrails. Put pressure on service providers to not embed agency into their AI products.\nI don't want the future where AI has spun out of our control. We don't have a kill-switch if it can copy itself to any computer on the Internet. Pulling the plug is a reaction, speaking up now is our best chance at avoiding that emergency situation.

MS is nicknamed the snowflake disease, because it can affect people in wildly different ways. My experience with MS has been relatively mild, but with major ups and downs, as well as an over-arching threat of great disability in my future.\n&quot;Maintain hope for good things&quot; was a common message that others gave to me when I was first diagnosed. I sneered at the platitude internally. How dare you assume there's something good that I can ever experience now? Don't talk to me about hope. Hope is for fools.\nI think I was both right and wrong. It's a paradox: how do you continue living today, when you have no guarantees of tomorrow? As it turns out, this isn't a problem just for people with MS\u2014it is the human problem. Everyone has to grapple with this at some point. No one is guaranteed a &quot;tomorrow,&quot; because there is no way to avoid pain or death.\nAlthough no one is exempt, I think it's easier to push off this paradox almost like a survivorship bias. When I'm healthy and feeling good, I don't put any thought to it, because I live my days in a long, unbroken chain. The past makes the future seem predictable: wake up, exercise, go to work, watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer, fall asleep, repeat.\nLast week, however, I was hit with something that broke my chain. I've only had two migraines in my whole life until last week when I had three: Saturday, Thursday, and Friday. After two migraines, I was worried\u2014is this a pattern? Did I just push past recovery too fast? Once the third one hit, the fear really sunk in: Is there something wrong with my brain? Has MS progressed more than I know? Is this something to expect more of in the future?\nAt times like these, when uncertainty slaps my face, the paradox comes into full view. What is the point of continuing on, when there is great risk of suffering in the future? Why not end it now?\nHumanity is Resistance\nIn the overwhelming circumstances we're facing today from technology to politics, everything seems like it is outside our reach of influence. Everything feels futile\u2014pointless and ineffective, unchangeable. \nWhen I receive responses from my messages to senators or when I see what my country's current administration is doing, I find myself clawing through the muck in search of humanity. It can't be gone, can it? What can I even do? I'm one person against a machine; insignificant, disposable.\nMaybe it's a bug or maybe it's a feature, but humans seem to be pretty obstinate when we want to be. Personal experience has shown me that toddlers learn and latch onto the word, &quot;no,&quot; quicker than almost any other\u2014and proudly overuse their proclamation of resistance. High school history seemed to highlight oppressors and the resistance with figures like Mahatma Ghandi, Rosa Parks, or the &quot;Tank Man.&quot;\nThere's something about resistance that is deeply moving (ironically). I've been staring at the famous photo of the &quot;Tank Man&quot; and I feel simultaneously terrified and inspired. The fact that a single person could stop a line of tanks leaving Tiananmen Square in Beijing, China is stunning. As far as I know, we have no clue who the man is/was. Was it a normal day up until he saw the chance to literally take a stand? Was he actively looking for the opportunity over weeks and months, or was this spontaneous given the circumstance?\nI think there are two principles that can help us in our paradox of dealing with overwhelming systems and grave uncertainty:\n\nYou only have today\nBe a Zimbardo hero\n\nDivination\nIt seems like we've been conditioned to look into the future more than is healthy or necessary. Our species is a planning species\u2014we can see pretty far into the distance, and that increases the time we have to anticipate things that are coming or happening. That extra time allows us to make plans in anticipation of what we see coming. Technology helps us take this &quot;foresight&quot; from our natural eyes into a mystical realm. We can rely rather well on predictions about the weather, not just for today, but sometimes for an entire week. AI uses its predictions to surface content we'll probably like and engage with on social media. FBI profilers try to identify threats before they happen. \nWhile some of those things may be helpful or even crucial, I wonder if, individually, this expectation of seeing into the future is quite damaging? In terms of my health, MS is pretty unpredictable\u2014I don't know whether I'll have a good day or a bad day, I don't know whether these random, peripheral symptoms are a part of MS or if they're just a manifestation of stress on my MS-weakened body. It's actually been a huge mental health struggle for me as I consider what my future could be like. Every time a new symptom comes or a bad day arises, I feel trapped and squeezed, like the walls are pressing in around me.\nParadox is the isometric exercise of the mind. We want to see tomorrow, but we only have today. Is it possible to put the perspective of our lives in a better balance with time? The paradox is that you need to have direction (a &quot;vision&quot; of the future) in order for the day to be effective in helping to get you there. A year full of days with random actions will not get you where you want to go, but trying to see the future is an illusion that could also derail your path.\n\n    \n    Random actions compared with directed actions.\n    \n\nMy personal approach has been to shorten my view into the future\u2014looking only a few days ahead if at all\u2014and to abandon a sense of &quot;destination.&quot; Instead of having a goal that must be achieved in the future, I try to focus on values and compounds (I'm using this word in reference to the compound effect). Values are about who I want to be. Compounds are what I see growing behind me in retrospect: like seeing how CYBORG_ articles continue to be published, or other projects get completed, or emails get sent to senators. It's my body of work (or at least the artifacts of that work). That centers me pretty well on today. I don't know what effect I can have on the world (if any). I'm not planning some grand thing to be accomplished. Instead, every day that is a good day is a chance for me to live my values and work on my work.\nIt's a kind of resistance. \nResisting the pressures of others' expectations. Resisting the idea that my life is meaningless\u2014because I'm doing what I believe is right and I'm working on what matters to me.\nYou, too, only have today\u2014anything else is memory or possibility. What you do with all of the &quot;todays&quot; will pile up into something that you can examine after-the-fact. And this isn't just a fluffy cop-out: 10 days of effort put into your values and your personal priorities for action adds up. 100 days of it becomes self-advancing. 1,000 days of it becomes impressive. 10,000 days becomes monumental.\nZimbardo Hero\nPhillip Zimbardo was the infamous psychologist behind the Stanford Prison Experiment, in which participating students were randomly assigned to be either a prisoner or a guard. As Zimbardo recounts in the phenomenal book, The Lucifer Effect, the experiment quickly deteriorates into a disturbing, life-like experience of brutality and torture. The thing that struck me the most was how Zimbardo did not take away a grim view of humanity. \nFifteen years ago, I recall watching a video where Zimbardo explained that a hero is someone who does something that anyone could do, but that not everyone does. That was all I needed to hear to construct a new idea\u2014a value\u2014to work towards. I wanted to be a &quot;Zimbardo hero.&quot; It's not about doing some superhuman act. It's not about visibility or grand spectacles. It's about taking action when the need arises. \nWe can do that. We can choose to disconnect from our routine to help someone. We can take action in democracy (or whatever means you have available) to oppose inhumane and dangerous legislation. We can tell our boss that something is unethical. \nThe &quot;Tank Man&quot; is a Zimbardo hero to me. It wasn't much in terms of actions taken. But it did change the world\u2014here I am talking about it almost exactly 36 years after it happened.\nZimbardo's work throughout his life was all about how the situation can affect whether we'll do good or evil. The same situation can &quot;inflame the hostile imagination in those who become perpetrators of evil&quot; but can also &quot;inspire the heroic imagination in others or render most people passive bystanders and guilty of the evil of inaction.&quot; (TEDTalk, The psychology of evil).\nThe Zimbardo hero acts when others don't. The Zimbardo hero is focused on others, not themselves, so that when the situation arises, they can and will act.\nAlchemy\nThe combination of focusing on today and understanding that everyone\u2014including you\u2014can be a Zimbardo hero is how we can move forward. Yes, we are so much weaker alone\u2014but that's the illusion we should resist. We're not alone.\nThat isn't dismissing the reality and the deep pain of the loneliness that many of us feel. It is sometimes just so hard to see who is with you; really with you. \nHumanity is resistance. \nThat's how we stop oppression. That's how we make it through another difficult day of health challenges. That's how we continue on.\nIt hurts. It's scary. It's also contagious. Your heroism inspires more heroism. Your stand moves others to their feet. Your arm of support reaches farther than you know.

LEGO sets are systems that are constructed with removable or swappable LEGO bricks. Each brick has its own function and tries not to do more than one job at the same time\u2014you don\u2019t have an axle that also is a fire-looking brick that also is a person.\n\u201cSeparation of Concerns\u201d technically means that parts of code should be able to be edited or removed without breaking the whole system. A function that uses data shouldn\u2019t also be in charge of getting that data. The UI of your website shouldn\u2019t break when you update the text on the website.\nThis is an ideal\u2014not always possible, but you can get really close. The huge benefit to this is that we can make changes or even break small parts, but our whole system doesn\u2019t fail.\nIt\u2019s like Mitch Hedberg said, \u201cAn escalator can never break: it can only become stairs.\u201d That\u2019s a graceful failure!\nMeaningful Errors\nAnyone who has used the internet knows the error: 404, Not Found. You\u2019ve gone to a page that doesn\u2019t exist.\nSome sites go above and beyond and customize this error page\u2014they may even throw in a link or two to help you get back to the home page or a close guess at where you wanted to be. (The screenshot below gives people a chance to search the site)\nWhat about the other errors you can get? Sometimes you\u2019ll run into \u201cServer Error: 500.\u201d What does that mean? What are you supposed to do with that? This error page is much less likely to be customized and even less likely to be meaningful.\nUsually the devs have a way of getting to the meaningful error on the backend, but it\u2019s still a frustrating experience for you to have an error and zero context.\nMeaningful errors help everyone out. We can all troubleshoot better when we have a little bit of context. Maybe you tried to upload a file that was way too big\u2014how would you know that if all it says is \u201cSomething went wrong\u201d?\nWhether you\u2019re a programmer or a program user, meaningful errors are a key component to a better experience. Errors are unavoidable, so we should fail gracefully by providing descriptive errors, or at least errors that help you get back to a better state.\nEscapes and Exits\nDo you remember that awful false alarm that hit Hawaii in 2018? Everyone on the islands got an emergency alert that a ballistic missile threat was inbound. Turns out, no missile or even threat was imminent. The message was an accident.\nWith a breath of fresh air amidst the outrage at the time, I found an article with a different take on what happened: blaming the system design rather than the human error.\n\u201cAltogether a poorly designed system is to blame. A good UI makes it hard for people to err, and easier to recover from any remaining errors. The solution is not to scold users\u2026[but] to redesign the system to be less error-prone.\u201d\n\u200bhttps://www.nngroup.com/articles/error-prevention/\u200b\nTake care to examine your systems for deceptive messages, cryptic actions, confusing processes, and make sure that it\u2019s possible to recover or escape when highly impactful actions are taken. \u201cCancel\u201d buttons available when deleting, for example.\nI highly recommend reading the full article!\nFail Early\nThere\u2019s a sentiment from Silicon Valley: \u201cMove fast and break things.\u201d It\u2019s a little too brazen and risky, to me. I can appreciate the spirit of it though, which is more along the lines of: \u201cYou\u2019re not punished for breaking things, just keep trying.\u201d\nWith that more tempered view, I think we get broader application. Making mistakes, breaking things, running into problems is all part of the game\u2014no matter what your occupation or hobby.\nChris Do puts it well: FAIL = First Attempt In Learning.\nBuild that failure into the process\u2014expect it! Create a space where you can tinker without it affecting the rest of the system. Try to figure out what will solve your problem first, before trying to make it perfect.\nTesting frequently will help you discover the holes in your logic, the parts that don\u2019t work together. Check for errors as soon as possible and try to identify them before they affect things further down the line.\nDefaults\nIs there something that can be a safe placeholder if something breaks or doesn\u2019t show up? These aren\u2019t easy to implement, but when you look for opportunities to provide defaults, there are more than you might expect.\nFor example, you\u2019re building a slide-based presentation and you\u2019re waiting on numbers or images or other content. Can you move forward with what you have? Can you put conceptual images in as placeholders in case the Design team doesn\u2019t get to your deck in time?\nDefaults help you move forward when you don\u2019t have everything perfect. What\u2019s the least I can deal with and still launch successfully?\nDocument\nNot everything can be avoided by strategy or other safe-guards. Some mistakes or errors will come up frequently. If you have a place to store processes or solutions to these problems, it makes it so much easier and faster to handle.\nI\u2019ve mentioned this in previous emails, but I can\u2019t overstate how helpful this particular practice has been for me. I use Obsidian to collect these errors and the steps to resolve them, and it has drastically reduced the time it takes to fix things that are nuanced and uncommon.\nCyborg\nWe\u2019re not all coders, but we do deal with processes and systems all the time. Failing gracefully might mean giving context for mistakes you\u2019ve made or giving people options for proceeding when something goes wrong or you get stuck.\nThe smaller the \u201cscope\u201d of a project or the more isolated a part of a system, the easier it is to control the impact of its failures. That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t work on big things\u2014but remember that all big things are composed of smaller things.\nIf you can carve out these smaller pieces and set failure procedures for them, it helps clamp down the potential chaos when it\u2019s integrated with the larger whole. Tags: "}, {"title": "How Do You Recognize a Merism?", "category": "Newsletters", "href": "/newsletters/how-do-you-recognize-a-merism/", "body": "We use merisms to emphasize inclusivity, but it's up to us to draw out what's in between. \u00b6 I stepped over a few boards and navigated around the maze of construction materials. There was a light on in the back half of the warehouse where we found a few chairs to sit on. It was a freezing cold evening in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, and I had come to this odd place to meet my wife's friend, a respected scholar and writer in the LDS community. We had chosen this location because we could meet with relatively low risk without putting masks on, but the space ultimately represents what I learned in conversation there.\nWe meandered through lots of fascinating topics as we chatted, when eventually she taught me a new word: merism. She was referring to a verse in the Book of Mormon that contained this &quot;merism&quot;:\n\n\n&quot;...he\u00a0inviteth\u00a0them\u00a0all...black and white,\u00a0bond and free, male and female;&quot;\n\n\n2 Nephi 26:33\n\n\nA merism is a way to emphasize a reference to &quot;everything,&quot; by highlighting two extremes within that &quot;everything.&quot; For example, in college, I would work day and night on print-making projects. This implies that I was doing those kinds of projects all the time\u2014even though in this case, it's hyperbole, since I certainly did not work on anything continuously.\nTo me, this little rhetorical device has the potential to open up spaces where we might not have seen space before. Even though a merism is usually about identifying binaries, I've found more gradients as I've paused and looked at them more closely. So, in honor of Pride month, let's take a look at the stuff in the &quot;in-between.&quot;\n\n    \n    \"All of this is gray\" indicating the largest portion of a gradient between the color white and the color black.\n    \n\nMany merisms\nBack to the scripture reference mentioned above, we see three sets of these merisms: \n\nblack and white\nbond and free\nmale and female\n\nThe first set is referring to race as a concept of skin color. Bad theology and racism of the Church and/or contributors to the text aside, the text itself is attempting to present the idea that your race (a.k.a. your skin color) has no effect on God's invitation to come to Him. This merism presents us with our first opportunity to break out of binary thinking.\nI don't think they are supposed to do this, but what if we took a moment each time we recognize a merism and considered what is in between the two highlighted things? Who might be forgotten in our shortcut of saying &quot;black and white&quot;? If it's hard to identify someone or something else in between the two endpoints, that's our cue to look for more diverse voices, concepts, and stories. (If you want a great book on race in the U.S., you might consider So You Want to Talk About Race by Ijeoma Oluo)\nBond and free can also be a merism, because at least from my view, there is a gradient of experiences between bondage and freedom. Some people are in bondage even while technically being free, such as those whom the United States (and many other places) intentionally and systematically oppress. There are all kinds of bondage: from addiction to debt to disability. There are all kinds of freedoms: from having rights to having privilege or wealth or time. \nOnce again, our merism highlights extremes, but provides us the chance to fill in the blanks, practice empathy, and consider alternate view points. An excellent resource to explore bondage and freedom is The New Jim Crow by Michelle Alexander (in the context of the U.S., though it may have implications in other places).\nAnd finally, we have our gender merism: male and female. Are there only two genders\u2014or two sexes? The context here might say no\u2014not because the author's intent was to imply a spectrum, it almost certainly wasn't possible for the author to conceive of that, given the historical context. Rather, it's an opportunity to consider making space since we now know so much more about humanity's diverse experience with gender and the varying presentation of biological sex.\nMy point here is that if we're going to treat the first two sets as gradients, we can do the same for the last set since the precedent is already there. Maybe it's a way to start opening up doors that used to be slammed shut by ignorance and fear.\nIf you want to explore the gender merism in a more Christian context, I highly recommend the book Transforming by Austen Hartke. He does an excellent job of examining theological perspectives, biblical examples, and contemporary stories.\nIn sickness and in health\nMy own body has taught me about this merism. Multiple sclerosis (MS) has shown me that the lines between &quot;sick&quot; and &quot;healthy&quot; can be quite blurry. MS impacts me every day, even when I'm feeling great, because it takes the reasonable predictability out of my grasp. Some days, when I feel really good, I push myself too hard and I end up crashing in the afternoon. Other times I know the whole day is just bad. And that's nowhere near the extreme end.\nWhen I had my first (and so far, only) MS attack, I was so overwhelmed with grief. My body had lost everything I loved: coordination, energy, and clear thinking. It completely changed my scale of experience with health and sickness. Suddenly I knew things can get much, much worse\u2014and I was never going to be quite as well as I had been before.\n\n    \n    Before MS and after MS, my scale of health and sickness drastically changed.\n    \n\nIn my immaturity prior to my diagnosis, I often found myself being quite judgmental of people around me. I often classified people as lazy or weak if they had a difficult time waking up in the morning, or if they tired out more quickly than I did, or if they complained for any reason about a task.\nMy MS attack sharply humbled me and opened my eyes to the massively diverse experiences possible in the context of health and stamina. This was a merism with a vast middle range that I could no longer escape.\nLife experience is what helps us to break out of the constricting binaries that we're surrounded with. Even recognizing that your experience and your reality is different than everyone else's is a helpful practice to stay curious and to see past assumptions or stereotypes.\nCYBORG\nWe use merisms to emphasize inclusivity, but it's up to us to draw out what's in between. It can be a trap for us to stay in a binary mindset, where things are easily classified as &quot;black&quot; or &quot;white.&quot; It's on us to decide to use this shortcut as a reminder instead of a reinforcement. \nI think this is particularly potent as we continue to be drawn to our technological echo-chambers. Social media and other AI or algorithmically supported content feeds can and do make us feel connected and validated, since we're served pieces that we already agree with. That's why I think we have to find our own &quot;technology&quot; to remind us that there is a lot more nuance out there than what we see all day. \nAnd it's something we should celebrate.\nI've found it is easier to access my own humanity when I open up to more diverse ideas and listen to the experiences of others. It may not be practical to name everything in a gradient, but it's worth focusing on the under-represented and elevating their voices and experiences wherever you can.\nTo me, merisms are about making larger spaces between two extremes. Life is complex, humans are complex, and there's more than enough room for everyone.

Let's put it this way: there's more than one creature looking for your brain. \u00b6 It was a brisk November night. I was anxiously touching the trigger of my gun just to reassure myself that it was there, ready. A giant soccer goal was being pulled into place at my right, acting as a barrier, and 40 or 50 people backed up with me into the chain link fence.\n&quot;Get ready!&quot; someone shouted into the moonless night. The only light dimly drifted onto the field from a building 300 feet away.\nThe chill of the imminent threat zapped through my spine and around my ears. At the other end of the field, a crowd was gathering. An amorphous mass of bodies moving both individually and collectively was both growing and approaching.\n&quot;Hold!&quot;\nOur two groups faced each other for the longest, quietest seconds. Frozen on the outside, but heart pulsing on the inside, I gripped the handle tighter, shifted my weight slightly to the back foot and sank ever so slightly, trying to manage my center of gravity.\nA roar erupted from the mass ahead. They began to charge us.\nDarts and sock-balls started flying as we opened fire on the zombies that were trying to keep as few of us remaining humans from reaching the extraction point. It was the final battle after a week's worth of hiding, sneaking, and running from zombies on campus.\nIt was the most fun and intense game I had ever played.\nThe zombies in front of the crowd were peppered with our projectiles, but they could hardly get out of the way (as was the rule), because of the gigantic crowd behind, pressing them into our trapped group.\nI blinked once and shot a few zombies with my Nerf gun. I blinked twice and all I could see was blades of grass and the faint light from that building so far away.\nI had been knocked to the ground. A body fell on me and seconds later was off of me.\nThis was one of the first times I realized I was in actual, physical danger. My thought was, &quot;So this is how people die in crowds,&quot; having recently read a book about disasters. Luckily, the crowd of zombies somehow dispersed. Although we were counted as having won the game, I'm sure we wouldn't have been so lucky in a &quot;real&quot; zombie apocalypse.\nI did come away with the coolest scar and story, though, right?\n\n    \n    Selfie with my nerf gun, bloody nose-bridge, and my battle-face.\n    \n\nAlthough we have no reason to fear a zombie apocalypse, I think there is a valid parallel that brings these undead terrors to the forefront of our current reality.\nZombies in the Real World?\nDespite usually being characterized as dim-witted and slow, the modern zombie (also called the\u00a0Romero Zombie) has a lot of profound uses in exploring contemporary fears and social problems. From the shocking end in the classic movie\u00a0Night of the Living Dead\u00a0that reveals the systemic racism in the U.S. to the minimizing of female contribution to survival and worth that is only tied to \u201ctraditional\u201d gender roles in\u00a0The Walking Dead\u00a0(1).\nToday, we\u2019ll focus on just two zombie concepts:\n\nThe danger of crowds  \nThe Apocalypse\n\nWhat does an apocalypse even mean? This is my understanding of the word based on cultural context clues: Destruction; a final wipe-out of humanity. I think of zombies or nuclear devastation, and how there was at least one apocalypse in every season of\u00a0Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\nLooking at its\u00a0Greek origin, however, it meant \u201cto uncover, reveal.\u201d That took me by surprise, especially given the long Christian history with the concept of\u00a0The Apocalypse, which is often described as a gigantic collection of world-wide catastrophes and/or wars just before the Second Coming of Christ.\nAs a thought experiment, what might it mean if we looked at the Zombie Apocalypse trope not as a lesson about violence, gore, and survival, but as a revelation? What might be uncovered by our rotting corpses?\nOne piece we can look at is the fear that zombies embody\u2014not literally, though, that\u2019s out of scope, though we have looked\u00a0briefly into disgust\u00a0before. If we zoom way out so we aren\u2019t distracted by the unsavory appearance, we\u2019ll see crowds. Just like my \u201cFinal Stand,\u201d I was completely unnerved when the crowd of \u201czombies\u201d started to gather across the field.\nCrowds can be deeply terrifying. The mass moves as if it\u2019s one organism made of smaller parts. In some cases, crowds can\u00a0kill just from the movement alone, no malice necessary. We have the psychological phenomenon of\u00a0groupthink, where there is \u201ca deterioration of mental efficiency, reality testing, and moral judgment in groups that have an excessive desire to reach consensus\u2026[G]roupthink emerges when maintaining a pleasant social atmosphere becomes more important than making the best decision.\u201d (2)\nWe can be exceptionally lonely in crowds. Being among large masses can remove your feeling of individuality as you blend in with all of the other bodies, like a fish in its school or an ant in its colony.\nThere\u2019s even the spark of fear when it comes to work, like mass layoffs whether in the\u00a0U.S. government\u00a0or in the\u00a0callous trend with tech companies.\n\n\nThe zombie apocalypse is a white-collar nightmare: a world with no need for the skills we have developed. Lawyers, journalists, investment bankers\u2014they are liabilities, not leaders, in the zombie-infested world.\n\n\n\u2014Slate, \u201cFirst, Eat All the Lawyers,\u201d by Torie Bosch, Oct 25, 2011\n\n\nI\u2019m not attempting to demonize large gatherings of people, but they do come with concerns that vary from circumstance to circumstance. Zombies can help us explore those dangers, and they may also be aiding our quest for \u201crevelation.\u201d As we confront these terrifying creatures, we start to see these connections to our reality, and we\u00a0uncover\u00a0the collective fears our society shares. A crowd realizing its fear of the crowd, in a way.\n\n[Zombies] are personifications of our mediated social perceptions, and their symbolism becomes that much more significant at a time when so much of our daily lives are dictated by our interactions with media.\n\n\u2014Thinking Dead,\u00a0Balaji, page X\nDr. Yii-Jan Lin recently wrote a book,\u00a0Immigration and Apocalypse: How the Book of Revelation Shaped American Immigration, that explores how apocalyptic imagery has been applied to U.S. immigration policies. Not only in the administrative sense, but also in inciting mass fears, racism, and xenophobia for U.S. citizens over the country's history. As I listened to the discussion she had about\u00a0the concepts in her book, I couldn't help but see the connections to the zombie apocalypse that I had seen on the silver screen.\n\nYou'll see depictions in some political cartoons I included in the book where you have Chinese coming over from China and escaping famine in the end of the 19th century and they're portrayed as grasshoppers...It seems right out of the book of Revelation when they're like a horde of locusts [with] human faces but there are these animal insect creatures that are eating everything up...Or you see Eastern Europeans leaving the shores of Europe to swim towards America as a herd of rats. So also understood in terms of plague and especially in terms of the black plague leaving European shores for the US and so that's all used in anti-immigration discourse, cartoons, literature... \n\n\u2014Dr. Yii-Jan Lin,\u00a0Data Over Dogma, timestamp 22:10\nWhether through a zombie virus, or just the inexplicable rising of undead hordes, modern zombies fit within the West's ancient tropes about apocalypse, calamity, and destruction.\nIt makes me wonder if this apocalyptic imagery or rhetoric is really just a technology that we have developed over the years to convince the hordes within our in-group that we must take action against the hordes of the out-group? It is certainly a dangerous form of rhetoric and has caused deep harm and trauma to countless amounts of people throughout history.\nWe may be quick to dismiss the modern zombie as something silly or just for movies, but I think we'll be well-served to reflect deeply when any apocalyptic symbols are used in our speech. When politicians choose a population to demonize, we should be suspicious. Maybe our fears are what transform\u00a0us\u00a0into the mindless husk that follows the crowd, seeking human flesh?\nWorks Cited\n(1) Savior narratives, and logistics of survival in The Walking Dead, By Martina Baldwin and Mark McCarthy.

They'll get the right number of windows or some other feature without trying to...&quot;\nI was drawing a window that caught my eye in Switzerland and overheard my professor talking to the other chaperones. I tried to ignore it, but I couldn't help feeling the stares as I sat on the ground sketching while everyone else was waiting for our train. The spotlight effect made me wonder if my professor had been talking about me, because, as I realized, my little sketch was actually pretty accurate to life.\n\n    \n    Sketch of a Swiss window\n    \n\nIn reality, I doubt that they were able to see me at work in my sketchbook right then, but that little conversation stuck with me, and a curiosity has emerged over the past 14 years that I've been back from my study abroad: How powerful is drawing? What's the point of drawing if you're not an artist? Does drawing matter anymore?\nI wish that drawing was not so intimidating to people. I've been more comfortable with it than most, because I've had years of interest and training in mark-making, drawing, and fine arts. But the vast majority of people I've talked to immediately shun their drawing skills\u2014laughing at the idea of drawing, saying they can't draw a stick-figure, or claiming that they just don't have the talent for it as though drawing is a special gift bestowed on the prodigious.\nThis is a great loss, especially as technology and AI are smothering our senses and are effectively becoming our environments.\nPresence\nAs someone who likes to create videos, I'm frequently torn as I consider taking video or enjoying the moment\u2014especially if I have gone somewhere unique. It's not just wanna-be YouTubers like myself, you see people with their camera apps on their phones at any event, anywhere you go. \n\n    \n    \nCropped photo of a crowd with phones recording video by Aditya Chinchure on Unsplash\n\n\nContrasted with my experience in Switzerland where I didn't even have a phone let alone a phone with video capability, I have wondered if I have lost something. During my program in Europe, I only had my sketchbook. I wasn't able to capture much of the stunning visual environment that is Switzerland, and the sketches don't compare to what I know classmates have: beautiful photographs and videos taken with telephoto lenses. And yet, the sketches I do have are also much more meaningful to me and have somehow captured more of the story than a photo typically does.\nThat one small sketch of a random window encoded the overheard conversation my professor was having behind me. Every time I look at that drawing, I think of what I heard while drawing; how the cloudless sky allowed the sunlight to drape over me with perfect warmth; how the concrete felt on my calves as I sat cross-legged, cradling my sketchbook.\nThere's something about drawing that gets all of my senses involved. It's a slower process, and like my professor pointed out in the rest of his observation:\n&quot;It forces them to really look at the thing. Even if you've seen it before, when you draw it, you are noticing the details. It's like you're seeing it for the first time.&quot;\nThat's not to disparage the art of photography or videography (I think you can be just as intentional, present, and aware with those art forms), but snapping some quick photos or selfies or random panning videos is not the same as composing, planning, and executing a shot. When I've gone to a new place or an event, I feel pressure to take a quick snap, almost like it proves I was there. I feel compelled to remember the experience because it's so unique. Ironically, the uniqueness is already what will help me remember, but the random photos collected into a vast archive on the cloud is distracting me from engraving the moment in my memory.\nWhile photographs can help us remember\u2014no doubt about that\u2014they also seem to take us out of the moment. At least in my experience, capturing snapshots puts me in a disembodied state. I'm viewing the experience through my phone's screen instead of through my own eyes. Drawing forces me to be extremely present, because I'm very focused on one thing, appreciating the shape or line or movement and distilling the information down into something that represents it on paper.\nUtility\nThe benefits of drawing aren't restricted to capturing memories, especially if drawing from life isn't something you've practiced. I think that drawing may well be critical to surviving the digital age. The utility of a drawing isn't just the end-product, and the image is usually less valuable overall anyway. I think the real usefulness is in the process of clarifying your thoughts.\nThere are endless apps\u2014and now AI\u2014that can help you create &quot;polished&quot; images, charts, and graphs, but just like taking out your phone for a random snapshot, these really aren't useful if they aren't helping you understand your own thoughts. Drawing is the low-cost, low-tech, accessible method to quickly move something from your mind to paper. And once it's on paper, you can work with it further.\nWhen I'm trying to code some new system, I reach for a pen more often than not. A quick sketch of my idea is immensely helpful to validate the plan in my mind\u2014or to recognize issues I didn't notice before. These are not beautiful sketches. They're ugly boxes with arrows, messed up lines, and a few words that are barely readable. These aren't precious; I throw these away (delete them, since I often turn to my tablet for these kinds of single-use drawings).\n\n    \n    Quick sketch of layout options for a website editing feature.\n    \n\n\n    \n    Rough layout drawings for sections of a website.\n    \n\n\n    \n    Plan for a form including input types and notes about functionality.\n    \n\nWhat weighs on my mind is a future where we have wholly dismissed drawing as a tool and treating it as a product instead. If the sole purpose of drawing is the image at the end, then it will be boiled down to some easily reproducible, ubiquitous, and meaningless repetition of stale ideas. Basically, we'll get AI-generated imagery.\nWhere factories and AI both tend toward the average, we can go back to this ancient tool. Drawing is one of the most fundamental forms of communication and the more I do it, the more I'm convinced of how effective it really is. \nJust last week, I had a completely new experience with drawing. An art therapist was invited to lead a group session at work, and I was surprised to discover yet another way that drawing could be powerful. I came to the session ready to put away my artistic training, because I wanted to understand how art therapy might work if I had no theories and techniques swirling in my mind while drawing.\nTo start us off, she provided a prompt of an emotional state (fear, acceptance, anticipation, etc.) and we had one minute to draw out that representation. We went through eight of these prompts, and my approach was to really try and access a childlike mindset: making quick decisions (not analyzing or planning too much), drawing by feeling rather than by intellect.\n\n    \n    Emotion states drawn quickly with oil pastel.\n    \n\nThe result surprised me. The first thing I noticed was that &quot;joy&quot; was an emotional state that doesn't feel well developed to me (that's the one represented by the single green circle). It is a state I have been in much less frequently throughout my life and is very difficult for me to capture. This translates to other artistic expressions\u2014I'm not just basing this on the exercise above\u2014since I have routinely struggled to create art or write music that is about joy or happiness. The unpleasant emotions are much easier for me to access, and to me, this simple exercise helped underscore that aspect of my emotional life.\nThere were many other insights I pulled out of this, like how my recent health concerns are occupying my mind and how fear and anger are so interconnected to me. The most interesting to me is how applicable this simple act of drawing can be in any part of our lives.\nIf you haven't drawn something in a while\u2014try it again. Find a scrap of paper in the trash, go to a corner where no one can see you, and scribble out that thing that's been on your mind. Hide it or share it\u2014whichever helps you keep the confidence to do it again. \nThe goal of drawing isn't always creating a beautiful thing. Sometimes the goal is to do the opposite: create an ugly thing. Even more impactful is a goal to clarify or reveal your thoughts and feelings. Drawing doesn't need to be life-like, colorful, or clean to be powerful. It just needs to be done.

However, there is something that happens when the fingerprints of humanity are left on our machines, and that might bring out some surprising behavior from the cold, stoic technology.\nShadows\nI don't know about you, but when I think about technology, I think of it in terms of stability, facts. It's unfeeling, unbiased, unemotional. It's something reliable. 1+1=2, no matter how many times you punch it into the calculator. If you get the wrong answer, it's because you, the human, messed up\u2014garbage in, garbage out after all!\nHow is it, then, that we're seeing really good evidence that artificial intelligence has racial biases? Gender biases? If AI really is just another tool, why is it falling for the same old fallacies, stereotypes, and prejudices that we humans have? Does this not demonstrate a kind of consciousness? Or maybe it means that the human creators were pulling the wrong levers\u2014passing their personal biases onto their creation?\nI think there is more to it than simply pointing at the creators and saying they just hard-coded some problematic stuff into it (not that they don't have serious responsibility for what they have done, bad intentions or not). I also do not think this is actually unique to AI alone. Potentially, these biases have accompanied our tech for far longer than we've realized.\nConsider this observation by Jun'ichir\u014d Tanizaki:\n\nJapanese music is, above all, a music of reticence, of atmosphere. When recorded or amplified...the greater part of its charm is lost...Most important of all are the pauses. Yet [the recordings] render these moments of silence utterly lifeless. And so we distort the arts themselves to curry favor for them with the machines.\n\nTake a guess when this was written. 2000? 1990? Maybe 1970? Nope. He wrote this in his essay, In Praise of Shadows, back in 1933. Even more profound were the musings on technology and culture. Tanizaki mourns the losses felt in Eastern culture as Western technology was invading: photography, radio, trolleys, airplanes.\nHe notes that, left alone, the East may have continued to develop slowly\u2014at their own pace\u2014but that they would have gone only in a direction that suited us. The technology would have been developed in support of their values, their complexions, their landscape.\nThey would have been no borrowed gadgets, they would have been the tools of our own culture, suited to us.\nTo me, this was a paradigm shift. Suddenly, I can see how technology is not some set-apart thing. It absolutely does have bias, opinion, stereotypes, built in. Not necessarily due to ill-intent or some grand attempt at large-scale oppression (though that's entirely possible). But technology is inescapably linked to culture and the values of that culture will therefore permeate the tech for better or worse.\nIt's not because the technology is alive or conscious or self-aware. It is because technology is the shadow of humanity. We build it after our likeness, and it reflects that shaping back to us\u2014recognizable if we decide to look at the shadow, but just as easily slipping into the environment as a subtle, unimposing thing.\nShadows can create beauty as Tanizaki argues in his essay, but they can also hide dangers. Perhaps especially for Westerners, shadows are uncomfortable. Maybe we're afraid of seeing what we've built into the darkness. If you can bear to look at the shadow, the question becomes: what do you see?

This particular phantom was a canvas that I had messed up while painting. It had a beautifully blended rainbow background, starting at the top with a deep crimson, melding into orange and yellow, then somewhat sharply changing to green, then blue, and a hint of indigo at the bottom. The idea was to depict a sunset over water, so that my Pride-flag colors could be projected onto a somewhat natural scene. The only flaw was that the transition to the &quot;water&quot; surface got a little too abrupt with a few misplaced strokes of green that were too high to make it appear intentional, and too dark to hide under another coat of yellow.\nFinally fed up with its taunts, I grabbed my paints, determined to try again. I had a ruined canvas before me, but the original image and composition still interested me, so I turned it into an experiment to see if it could work in a different style: instead of a perfectly smooth gradient, I opted for something messy and chaotic. I layered on the paint, rebuilding scene on top of the previous one, but this time I didn't care about perfection. I wasn't painting\u2014I was playing.\nIn perfect irony, the final image was much more visually appealing\u2014even with the exact same issue that it had before: small green splashes of paint on top of the fragile yellow area. I had gotten carried away with my palette knife, just like I had with my brush last year. This time around, however, this doesn't bother me\u2014it's not trying to be photo-realistic, it's trying to say something.\n\n    \n    The initial sketch for the painting on the top left and the redone, full canvas on the right.\n    \n\nWu Wei\nIn Dao De Jing, this phrase wu wei comes up a lot. It describes a concept of non-coercive action. It's about flowing instead of forcing. While I'm not going to do justice in explaining (or even understanding) this Taoist concept, what I have learned in trying to wrap my Western mind around it has been insightful and widely applicable.\nThe first iteration of my painting process was mostly me trying to force something. When I made a big mistake, it was unrecoverable. I had built a fragile system\u2014a collection of decisions that could not adapt to variability. So when I prepared to try again, I tried tricking my brain into letting go by treating my canvas as if it were another being that I was going to interact with.\nWe can animate the painting (i.e. treat it as if alive) and imagine that it has a will of its own, and our job as artist is to reveal that painting: listen to it, pull it out. I think that's an intuitive way that many artists like to think of their work, especially after the Renaissance shifted the pressure to be the genius rather than to have a genius. It's much easier on your mental state if you can separate yourself from what you produce. Otherwise, you may get too deep into judgment or worry more about unachievable standards than making the art.\nThe second iteration of my painting had the intention of losing myself in the process: I wanted the painting to reveal itself to me through wu wei\u2014flow\u2014making decisions based on what was presented to me, rather than playing god and forcing it to do what I want even when it doesn't work. This method was more enjoyable because the stakes were removed. I wasn't trying to prove how technically skilled I was. I was watching the painting take shape over time and reacting to what I saw. I still had a basic composition in mind, but it was not about copying my imagination directly onto canvas.\nAdam Savage, one of the hosts of the hit series MythBusters (2003\u20132016), had a similar experience on his YouTube channel, Tested. He was building a life-size &quot;velociraptor&quot; puppet, similar to what you'd see on Jurassic Park.\nThere's a moment in which the object tells you what it's going to be, he remarked. He had been set on creating a green-toned skin for his dinosaur model, but as he worked with it, he ended up changing the entire color scheme to a more sandy/desert style, and I personally thought it was the perfect choice.\nIn my mind, this is wu wei. It's a collaboration between material and artist.\nRawhide Drum Making\nI took a community class last year that promised a rawhide drum that we would make and learn to play. It was quite simplified and most of the difficult work was done outside of the class by the material suppliers (all from Indigenous-owned businesses). We had wood frames already made and even the rawhide had been dyed and processed.\nEven though we were really just assembling the drum, rather than making one from scratch, there was still a part of the process that tapped into this wu wei concept. The instructor showed us how to take our pre-soaked rawhides and pull them taught around the wood frames. It was a lot of pulling and folding and manipulating the hide, trying to coax it to conform to the circular shape without too many creases or bumps. Then we added the rawhide strings to the back to keep the tension and create the handle.\n\n    \n    Back of the drum, showing nine tensioning strings with two wrapped together to form a handle to grasp.\n    \n\nThe animal will tell you about itself, my instructor said as she wandered through the desks. You can have an idea of what it will be, but ultimately, you have to work with the deer to let it show you what it will become.\nThis was the best part of the class: getting yet another culture's perspective of this wu wei concept. The hide of the deer told me a story: it has scars and bumps and spots that showed through the dye. In a way, the animal still had some say in its transformation from hide to drum. It didn't matter how hard I pulled, there were parts that would not lie perfectly flat or curve the way I wanted. After stringing and tensioning the back, I discovered that the hide had a natural hole on the edge (as opposed to the pre-punched holes from processing), meaning I had nine lines instead of the expected eight.\nThe sound of each drum would also be unique, and change over time as the hide settled on the drum and dried. Get to know your drum, became the instructor's refrain across each class session.\nOnce again, the final product was a collaboration, not a domination.\n\n    \n    Front of the rawhide drum showing the scars that the deer had acquired during its life (all of the thin lines and some of the small dots are scars).\n    \n\nCyborg\nWhile this may seem to be art-focused, I believe that wu wei is widely applicable and useful in our lives. Perhaps art is just a training tool to help us practice recognizing the paths set before us and then taking the opportunity to follow where they lead. Not to be confused with inaction, non-coercive action is an attempt to work with what we have and to honor the agency or the dignity of other creatures and things.\nIn a modern context, we might be tempted to see things like a social media feed as following a path\u2014after all, it is constantly providing you with things that are easily followed. This is inaction, however, because you are not collaborating. Your agency and your &quot;self&quot; are being rushed through a river that is designed to trap you in it. You are the material and the company is the artist that asserts its dominance over you. You will like this content, you will be distracted, you will be harvested for our gain without your true consent.\nNot all technology must be this way. Wu wei is difficult when our agency is not entirely our own, but it can be practiced, and it can be brought into your circumstance through intention. I believe this helps us flip back into a more agentive role, where we can become actors in our lives again, rather than objects ready to be turned into profits by other agents who do not respect wu wei or the humanity of others. \nI think wu wei can help us work with others in a non-destructive way. How else can we achieve something within a collection of other agents? When we respect the agency of other people, and even other animals or objects, we allow the art of revelation to work towards a positive outcome. We can still have our own ideas, but we allow each participant to reveal themselves in the process. We will never end up with what a single individual imagined, but that is not a loss; it's an improvement. There are better times ahead when we adapt, update, and move collaboratively. Anything else is ultimately destructive.\n\n\nWhile splitting up the world in making distinctions within it might seem to have a functional value, it always entails a diminution. The most effective way of cultivating order in the world, invariably relies upon the power of inclusivity.\n\n\u2014From the Commentary on Chapter 28 of Dao De Jing, Translated by Roger Ames &amp; David L.

What can you do? \u00b6 Books on tape were a constant source of entertainment and education as I grew up (aka audiobooks, now, for any young'uns out there). I also got lost in the world of old radio shows like The Life of Riley or Abbott and Costello's work and even the one and only The War of the Worlds broadcast. These productions had a way of capturing my attention while simultaneously releasing my imagination.\nListening was always a way to connect with these pieces in a way that felt different than reading the text. There was also one particular way of listening that is unequivocally my favorite thing in the whole world: having a family member read to me.\nMy sister has been generous enough to indulge me to this day, reading various fiction and fantasy novels to me. No longer in the same house, we have had to do this asynchronously through a video chat app. She'll read a few chapters and I'll catch up. Initially, I didn't think the magic would translate when we were no longer in the same room\u2014we couldn't snack on popcorn together, laugh riotously, or insert our commentary as the plot thickens.\nDue credit to her, though, for continuing to insert those moments into the video reading. She still does voices, she still complains about long lists of items in a paragraph. And this time, she did something that took my breath away.\nWe've been reading the newest book from The Hunger Games series called, &quot;Sunrise on the Reaping,&quot; by Suzanne Collins. It is utterly devastating. It has so many poignant moments in the book as it follows Haymitch Abernathy (Katniss's mentor and only survivor of the Hunger Games from their district for decades) as he is thrown into the Games as a teenager. There aren't tons of surprises, because we know how it ends just by having read the original series. And yet, expounding upon the torturous situation of the the Hunger Games made my heart break as I empathized with this character that I didn't really like from the books before.\nIt doesn't help that there are real images of real children starving and suffering in Gaza right now. It doesn't help that there is political and legal instability challenging what we thought was sacred, foundational, and untouchable. It doesn't help that in very real ways, there are horrendous and inhumane frameworks, structures, ideologies, and systems that exploit, terrorize, demonize, diminish, degrade, oppress, and indoctrinate in every corner of the globe. I do not make light of these realities. The Hunger Games is just fiction, but for me, it's a way to explore these situations and to pull these realities closer to my own\u2014they're not far off things in far off lands happening to some people. These realities are human, they are tangible, they affect me personally and they should affect me; affect us.\nAsync Humanity\nAs I was tidying up my desk and catching up to the final chapters of the book, all of a sudden the reading stopped. One second passed:\u00a0Maybe she\u2019s taking a drink. Three seconds passed:\u00a0Did I accidentally pause the video?\u00a0Five seconds and I finally realize my sister is struggling to continue reading.\nMy short-term memory spat out what we just read and what we were about to read: yet another tragedy from the slaying of a small child. Yet another battle of survival against the threat of the attacking child. Tears had come. The words were there but they couldn\u2019t be said.\nI sat there in distress. This was something I\u2019ve struggled with for so long: allowing my sister to be hurt, to be sad. I\u2019ve never wanted her to feel those things, and even when I\u2019ve been the one teasing, I feel immense guilt. I\u2019m supposed to protect her.\nBut I can\u2019t do anything\u2014this sadness, this hurt, it has all already happened, because this is a recording. All I can do is sit there \u201cwith\u201d her, feeling the pain, feeling the sadness\u2014not just from the book, but also from my sister\u2019s experience with the book.\nIt\u2019s a lesson my therapist has been trying to help me understand: I can\u2019t fix the discomfort or distress or sadness or pain of other people. I have to just be there with them.\nGranted, this may not have been helpful for my sister\u2014I can\u2019t speak for her experience being so vulnerable for\u00a0so\u00a0long on the video. To me, it was powerful because I realized this couldn\u2019t have happened on a normal audiobook experience. When I\u2019m listening to an official recorded book and start to cry, the performance moves on without me, and I end up suppressing the emotion, burying it for another time. But this time, it was baked into the experience. Fast-forwarding was an unthinkably violent act. There was no way out but through.\nAn audiobook of silence was when I heard the most.\nCyborg\nIt is a cruel paradox to live in this world, knowing that anywhere\u00a0many\u00a0people are suffering, all the time, for all possible reasons, and still having to live life yourself. The horrors we inflict upon each other affect us all\u2014there is no purity of cause, no true righteousness, because you can always pull on a string that leads you to yet another system, yet another travesty, yet another incomprehensible situation.\nIf we can\u2019t escape and we can\u2019t fix it (as\u00a0individuals), then what are we even doing here?!\nI\u2019m not a therapist, so this isn\u2019t advice, but I think something that I\u2019m learning is that I must slow down. It\u2019s not just about mental health, nor curbing addictive content feeds. It\u2019s about tapping into humanity.\nI couldn\u2019t console my sister\u2014it was literally impossible. I can\u2019t fix the famine and oppression in Gaza; I can\u2019t save the people who are terrorized just because of their ethnicity or race or queer identity; I can\u2019t heal the sick.\nThe only thing I can do is witness and weep.\nAfter that, I can do what I can do to humanize those whom I have seen\u2014really\u00a0seen\u2014so that we can start to reconnect and abandon the follies that got us here.

How do we improve the situation with AI when there are competing priorities? \u00b6 In a private communications channel centered around exploring AI, I posted several papers and articles that discussed the biases that are baked into AI (gender, race, etc.) and at the end asked:\n&quot;How do we know that [Product Name] AI doesn't have some or many biases? Is this a blindspot?&quot;\nI was attempting to start a conversation that would lead to some introspection. Instead I was met with some resistance, deflection, and dollop of man-splaining. The first response posed an important question, though:\n&quot;...I'm not sure we could ever eliminate it entirely. Not saying that we shouldn't try, we absolutely should\u2014I think the biggest question is, how do we make it economical to do so?&quot;\nAs we explored last week, though, the question sometimes needs to be questioned. I think this reveals some thinking errors in our current system, noble as it may seem to try and seek humane solutions through capitalism. I was able to muster enough courage to ask a confronting question in response (extremely difficult for my submissive personality): &quot;Is it ever economical to protect and focus on humanity?&quot;\nIs it ever economical to do what's right? \nMaybe\u2014I'm no expert in economics nor political science\u2014but personal experience tells me probably not. I've never personally seen a company (private or public) motivated to do what's right just because it's right. In fact, that's where I've run into some walls that I can't yet figure out how to climb, and I think this will help us examine this issue.\nThe Disabled God\nWhen I think of Greek mythology, Zeus, Athena, and Artemis come to mind: warrior gods; strong; fickle for sure, but powerful and able-bodied. I only recently found out that there is a god in the Greek pantheon who is disabled: Hephaestus.\nHe's the blacksmith god who decks out Achilles with a shield and crafts other armaments for various gods. According to the Illiad, Hephaestus enlists the help of automatons like &quot;handmaids&quot; made of hammered gold and wheeled tripods to assist with his craft and help him move.\n\n\n&quot;But Hephaestus also limps along on withered limbs, anticipating the great insight that both Plato and Marshall McLuhan would later insist upon: the technologies extend our creative powers by amputating our natural ones.&quot;\n\n\n\u2014Erik Davis, TechGnosis, pg. 18\n\nTo me, this starts to paint the picture of the conundrum that I'm in. Accessibility is the degree to which public spaces (physical or virtual) are usable by people of varying degrees of ability. Ideally, that would mean everyone can use a space or get what they need from a website.\nYou would think that this is just the default mindset, because when you spell it out it just makes sense. Of course we want people to be able to use our website, then we get more potential customers. However, despite my own conviction, despite my own advocacy efforts, I still haven't found sufficient time to learn and do everything I would like to in order to support accessibility in my work. I have to give the same trainings or reminders to the same designers on a consistent basis to stop putting together colors that don't have enough contrast just to read the text. If we can't move past the most basic accessibility principle, how can we ever get to a place where what we're creating is actually accessible?\nFor most jobs in most companies, the priority simply isn't there. And when it is, it still doesn't help like it could. In my na\u00efvet\u00e9, I once dreamed of starting a business in which I could build tools for someone with disabilities that would enable them to do their job as competitively as an able-bodied person. I thought that python code was the answer, because it had helped me stay afloat during my MS attack. But the economics weren't there. I was not able to figure out how to do it at a scale that would support my own livelihood, since I would have to custom-build tools for each specific job. Then came generalized AI, the adaptive solution that could help someone accomplish a variety of possible tasks\u2014the golden handmaids of Hephaestus, if you will.\nInstead of empowering the disabled to contribute and be included like Hephaestus, however, technology, especially with generative AI, seems to further disadvantage the disadvantaged. Rather than assisting us all equally, I am seeing evidence that AI is simply infiltrating as a competitor to humanity and creating a rift between the least- and most-abled people, like oil forcing water to the side.\n\n    \n    AI inserted into the middle of a scale between the least- and most-able takes up the most space and pushes humanity to the sides.\n    \n\nI'm deeply troubled that not only does it prevent the disadvantaged from catching up or staying in the same place, it's actually forcing them down. At what point will a company decide to hire a less-able person over some dirt-cheap AI product? At what point do we say, &quot;let's prioritize removing racial and gender biases from our AI product&quot; instead of, &quot;how can we capture more of the market this quarter&quot;?\nPeople are giving up on critical thinking, artistic expression, and basic logic, because they just lean on AI summaries or generated content. I'm starting to find AI-generated videos pretending to be funny &quot;can't believe they caught it on camera&quot; videos. The inauthenticity and the further reduction of quality that we are tolerating is the most disturbing to me. AI has served us well in fields of deep expertise, like in medical technology, but the current deployment and application of generalized AI doesn't seem to be helping as much. Erik Davis is spot on from what I'm seeing: &quot;the technologies extend our creative powers by amputating our natural ones,&quot; but it seems like the public-facing, general AI amputates more than it extends.\nCyborg\nI have no answers, I have no way to wrap this up nicely. I'll be honest that I'm despairing this week more than usual, because it feels so big and AI is simultaneously speeding things up. The safety mechanisms of regulations, standards, and laws feel paper-thin (especially laws in the U.S. right now). Where we could have deployed AI in a more human-focused way, we've opted for the &quot;quick profits now, fix things later&quot; approach.\nI feel like a cog in a system that is starting to spin too fast\u2014it's creating smoke in the machine and sparks are starting to fly. At what point do we end up burning out and tanking the whole system?\nAll I know is that I can't solve this one on my own. I don't know how to remove prejudice, take care of the disadvantaged, and improve the circumstances of the disabled at scale. So I guess I put my shoulder onto the wall again and keep pushing until it either breaks through or I get strong enough to climb over.

Instead, I travelled to an LGBTQIA+ conference to try and explore humanity &quot;in real life&quot; (something that's tough to do for an introvert like myself). I came away with some important themes that I think anyone, regardless of identity, can benefit from.\nRemember Who You Are\nFar from a trite aphorism, this concept seemed to permeate through the speakers and breakout sessions. Particularly in the sense of relationships with others, it's vital to remember who you are, and that you matter. I'm not even close to good at this, as I tend to yield to others' needs or wants, diminish my contribution to conversation, and assume that I don't matter even while affirming that everyone else absolutely does matter.\nPerhaps that's why this idea seemed to stick out to me, but here are a couple of snippets that I heard:\n\nIn response to the question of how to approach someone whose values conflict with yours: Values are different than personhood. If they want to deny you your personhood, that's not a value-based conflict. Remember who you are: you deserve dignity, respect. Removing those things from a person has nothing to do with &quot;values&quot; and everything to do with dehumanizing you.\nFor the &quot;yielders&quot;: Dare to say what's on your mind and reveal yourself. That's how you get stronger. Remember that who you are matters; your perspective; your needs; all of you.\nSometimes it's hard to maintain your sense of self in a relationship. The struggle is remembering: who am I and who are you in our relationship? Failing to remember who you are, even in a very close relationship, like with a spouse, can become unhealthy and ultimately betrays both you and the relationship. (Please speak to a mental health professional to explore more about any of this\u2014not a therapist, here, just a curious writer!)\n\nWe Are Starved For Love\nA lesbian bishop was part of a conversation for one of the sessions. She mentioned that she noticed throughout her ministry that people are starved for love\u2014everyone, not just marginalized groups. \nWe are so miserly with our love, she emphasized. \nMy tech-sense is tingling, and I wonder how we might find a better balance between our personal relationships and the strange new &quot;tribes&quot; that social media has caused to emerge. Note that I'm using the word &quot;tribe&quot; sarcastically, since that's a term ill-suited for these bizarre identity-based political groups, even though that's how you see it used across the Internet. In fact, I wonder if these false tribes have contributed to the collapse of our in-person relationships and have caused us to hoard our love, preventing it from leaking out to real people in real life. In fact, Dr. Lisa Diamond mentioned this in reference to non-human forms of safety-signaling:\nOur brains evolved to get our safety from actual people. Not signs or flags (or, I would add, AI). You can make your life safer with just one or two connections. This is an act of resistance\u2014the world wants you divided and isolated. Instead, increasing our in-person time with people we are safe to be ourselves with will help us reverse many of the negative effects we're seeing from our isolation.\nWe are all starved for love, so let's try to stop hoarding it and instead share it with the people in our lives.\nTrust That I Know Myself\nOne of the under-represented groups within the LGBTQIA+ community are the asexual (often shortened to &quot;Ace&quot;) and aromantic (&quot;Aro&quot;) groups. People who identify as Ace don't experience sexual attraction, and those who identify as Aro don't experience romantic attraction. This isn't a tragedy, this isn't a problem to be fixed. This is yet another example of the beautiful diversity of human experience.\nThe presenter who spoke from this group happened to be both Ace and Aro (somewhat rare). Her remarks had a consistent theme: don't invalidate someone's identity. She has been constantly peppered with questions like, are you sure? Have you just not met the right person? Or receiving comments like, that's so sad I could never imagine not loving someone.\nPeople don't see my identity as real or valid, she summarized.\nThinking about how a person can have a vastly different experience than my own, it reminds me of how Ed Yong helped readers of his book, An Immense World, get used to the idea of understanding the experience of other animal species:\n\nOur umwelt is still limited, it just doesn't feel that way. To us, it feels all-encompassing. It is all that we know, and so we easily mistake it for all there is to know. This is an illusion\u2014and one that every animal shares.\n\n\nNOTE: umwelt is a term he uses to refer to the reality a creature inhabits based on its sensory perception\u2014not just its environment, but how it understands and perceives it.\n\nNot only do we humans have a broad umwelt, we also have our own personal umwelts\u2014based on our senses, our abilities, our experiences, and our identity. With such diversity just within our own species, we can't possibly understand someone else's experience, but that doesn't mean it isn't real. Our experience may seem complete, all-encompassing, and all there is to know, but that is truly an illusion.\nIt's hard enough to know thyself, how do we ever dare to tell other people who they are (or who we think they should be)? Trust that I know myself, and work to know your &quot;self.&quot; No need to steal that responsibility from someone else.\nHuman\nI sat by myself in my introverted bubble for most of the conference, frequently weeping in silence. It's been quite the year of pain, isolation, and, most of all, feeling terrified that my neighbors might turn into persecutors. The rage and demonization expressed throughout the U.S. presidential campaign and new administration have set fire to my nervous system.\nTo take a break from that and sit in a room with 1,100 other queer people or allies was overwhelming. It was social safety, which, going back to Dr. Diamond again, is when you feel OK as you are with other people.\nI knew no one there personally, but tears immediately blinded me just by stepping inside a building where I knew I could be myself: introverted, queer, and everything else in between. There's something special about our humanity, and it's so easy to fade into the background of my day-to-day life. But this was a much-needed reminder that there are still humans out there. There is still community to be had. There is still dignity to be shared.\nYou matter. I matter.

The questions we ask are vital to the conclusions we can draw. \u00b6 When I was first diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), it took almost 6 months for me to start to recover from my MS attack. During that time I became acquainted with a question that still looms over me: Where is the worth of a person?\nThat's the more finalized version of the question. It started out with a lot more judgment and ableism. My prior model of the world involved measuring my worth by my productivity and achievement. I was only worth as much as I could learn, do, and produce\u2014and it wasn't enough just in comparison with myself, it was all about how much better I was in comparison with everyone else.\nWhen the MS attack took away my ability to think clearly, to move in a coordinated way, to do anything that I was normally able to do, I could only see myself as worthless. The question I had was much more like, When am I too worthless to be here? Eventually, however, I started challenging that first iteration of the question because it was harming me and I was desperate to find a better way\u2014a healthier way\u2014of thinking about my newfound condition. Many conversations with many people led me to adopt an assumption first, and then ask my question to see where it would go.\nThe assumption was: humans have inherent value. If that was true, then how can you have any worth if you can't do anything? I was still thinking in terms of ableism and productivity, but the question was at least pointed the other way: instead to trying to determine how you lose your value, I was searching for how (or whether) you maintain value, even when you can no longer contribute.\nThis was where I landed for more than five years (and I still find myself falling back to this version of the question when times are tough). I get stuck on &quot;contribution&quot; as a function of value: the more you contribute, the more valuable you are. But that doesn't explain why people love and care for others who are extremely disabled; bedridden; paralyzed; even comatose. I felt like I had to understand the extreme cases to console myself and find human worth.\nRecently, however, I noticed that my question was still flawed\u2014influenced by a system that does not prioritize our humanity, but attempts to suppress it.\nThe AI Question\nI've seen so many headlines and assumptions that say that Artificial Intelligence (AI) challenges what it means to be human. There has been unprecedented progress in generative AI's abilities to produce good work. We, somewhat collectively, do feel the threat of replacement looming as tech bros proclaim that AI will replace the majority of knowledge workers in just a few years. \nBut is AI really challenging what it means to be human? \nI readily admit that I tend to be contrarian\u2014highly suspicious of collective &quot;wisdom&quot; or conclusions that are shared on viral videos or memes. So when I see that the assumption behind this question put forth by journalists and creators, is that humanity is as simple as our productivity at work, I start to wonder if we've got the wrong question in our minds. \nJust like my journey with MS and my struggle to understand my worth, I got stuck on a poor question. It did not propel me forward, it kept me confounded. The AI question and my second question are the same: is the worth of a human tied to their productivity?\nThat question puts us on a path that tries to insert humanity into that which is absent of humanity by nature. We've discussed HADD Theory before, and I still find it the most compelling theory to explain why we squabble about whether these chat bots are conscious\u2014our brains are designed through evolution to notice and assign agency to things even if it's all imagined. I bring this up because I think that the question of AI consciousness is a dangerous distraction; a question that gets us stuck when there are real, pressing problems that should be addressed before we try and figure out if AI is alive.\nIf we get stuck on determining if AI is a kind of human, then we will be on the lookout for evidence. We will compare our humanity to what can be done on a computer. If AI can do it, and can sometimes do it better\u2014then where does humanity fit? The question is faulty, because, again, we're assuming that our productivity is what makes us human; what makes us valuable. AI replaces human productivity, therefore, AI is worth the same or more than humanity.\nBut our worth is not in our productivity. Our worth is not comparable to AI in any way; it is wholly independent of any form of AI, sentient or not.\nCyborg\nWe have to be careful about the questions we ask, because they influence what we are able to uncover. \nI do recognize that the AI question is also one of practicality: if we get replaced by AI, how do we continue to provide for ourselves in our current system? If everyone gets laid off, then how do we support anything? How do we survive?\nThe end of that question must be answered with policy and regulation. We must do something to protect laborers' (including knowledge workers') rights and remove power from the richest who are poised to exploit and profit the most. I don't know any other way right now to coexist with AI as a competitor in the workplace.\nThat said, I think we also need to move onto the more important version of the question of human worth. Maybe the next economic and social systems can only be constructed by focusing on it. For now, at least, it is how I find progress amidst uncertainty, distress, and fear. To keep the question in mind, &quot;where does my value come from?&quot; forces me to accept the assumption that I do have value. Divorced from productivity or skill or achievement or status or money or possessions or any other thing, there is only one explanation for where the worth comes from:\nI exist.\n Tags: Artificial Intelligence, Humanity"}, {"title": "The Problem with Creativity", "category": "Newsletters", "href": "/newsletters/the-problem-with-creativity/", "body": "Redefining creativity as a universal human trait can unlock problem-solving potential in every aspect of life. \u00b6 Ink sketch of a dinosaur skull wearing a crown\n&quot;Whoa, did you draw that?

It makes people judgmental, and not in the constructive way that critiques of the art piece can be.\nThey, the viewer, are judging themselves\u2014their artistic skills\u2014instead of appreciating the piece in front of them.\nAnd that approach also bleeds into our work, adding artificial limitations on our problem-solving abilities.\nWhat it comes down to is that creativity has nothing to do with art or design or even anything visual at all.\nEtymology to the Rescue\nCreative: \u201chaving the quality or function of creating,\u201d\n\u200bCreate: \u201cto bring into being,\u201d; \u201carise, be born, increase, grow,\u201d\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.etymonline.com/word/creative#etymonline_v_29034\nhttps://www.etymonline.com/word/create#etymonline_v_320\n\nDo you see how far off we\u2019ve pushed this concept?

But really, let's look at ways we can draw out our creativity.\nUniversal Principles\nAdd constraints\nPut a time-limit on your creative exercises\nSet up enough rules to help you avoid getting lost or overwhelmed in possibility\nNever judge during creation\nIf what you\u2019re working on doesn\u2019t seem to be doing what you want, start a new version, but don\u2019t tell yourself how bad you\u2019re doing\nYou aren\u2019t what you create\nFeel free to make judgment calls after you\u2019ve compiled all of your attempts/solutions. \u201cEditing\u201d is a vastly different exercise than \u201cwriting.\u201d\nTangrams\nOne of the most accessible creative exercises. You can make your own tangram pieces with a single sheet of paper.\nThese shapes can be used however you\u2019d like, but the classic rules are to not overlap them (put them next to each other, but not on top of each other).\nCreate shapes by rearranging the pieces (\u201ctans\u201d). You can try looking up tangram puzzles where you have to figure out how to replicate the image shown with the pieces you have.\nThis really gets the creative juices flowing, because it\u2019s problem-solving using constraints.\nComic Strips\nCreate your own tiny comic strip. Draw three boxes and try to tell a story. You can write words only, you can draw, you can just put in symbols.\nKeep the boxes pretty small\u2014that should help with your focus, like zooming in on a camera. Comic strips aren\u2019t graphic novels. Nice and simple!\nMake as many as you\u2019d like. Be funny or be serious. Political cartoons have always had a problem-solving nature\u2014whether raising awareness or calling out injustices.\nThis is a two-fer since comedy is itself a creative act.\nSketches\nThe simplest problem-solving tool. Sketching is not about artistic skill, it\u2019s about expressing the most rough, most simplified idea that might work.\nGrab a paper and pencil and draw or write out your thoughts. Try a little diagram of how some process might work.\nUse shapes and arrows or go ahead and sketch out forms and images.\nUse an audio recorder and talk it out if you don\u2019t want something visual.\nSketching can improve the clarity of your thoughts, even if you never use or share what you\u2019ve sketched.\nCreate the Future\nI'm 100% convinced that creativity will be the most in-demand, necessary skill starting right now. Saturation, out-sourcing, AI, and competition are spiking, and it's creativity that can pull you out of the crowd or make something work.\nStart small if you're uncomfortable. Start by identifying as a creative person.\nCreativity isn't genius. Creativity isn't magic. Creativity isn't unnatural to you.\nIt shows up over time and with practice.\nNow, go and create!

Here's what the CYBORG_ logo can mean. \u00b6 My friend threw a Christmas party and the crowd she invited was almost exclusively nerds (hence my invitation, I guess). We were engaged in making little ornaments out of various materials including wood circles that were cut from a fallen branch along with the usual crafting supplies. I got busy trying to do something overly complex on my little piece of wood, but I was mostly focused on eavesdropping on a conversation about something I'd never heard of before: a Moebius strip.\nThe engineer had cut a strip of paper, gave it a half-twist and then glued the ends together, making a weird, curvy shape\u2014almost like a rubber band that had gotten twisted. He said that the cool part about this shape is that if you take your finger and trace the edge all the way around, you'll never find an endpoint. The shape's edge is a single, continuous line.\nWoah, woah, woah, what did he just say?! I thought to myself. Abandoning my ornament, I slowly merged into the conversation like a squirrel cautiously inching closer to steal food. I grabbed a strip of paper, put the two ends together like a chain link, then gave one end a half-twist and pinched it together so I could compare my shape to the original. Once I figured out how to make it, I had to test this guy's claim that you could trace the edge around the entire shape (being careful not to get a papercut).\n\n    \n    Step 1: Bring the two ends close together as if to make a paper chain link.\n\n\n    \n    Step 2: Twist one end so that the top of the strip is on the bottom.\n\n\n    \n    Step 3: Glue the two ends together.\n\nTurns out, he was right. I tried it several times, and even though it's tough to maneuver around the tiny paper, it really is made of a single unbroken looping line. A three-dimensional shape made of a two-dimensional line! It was the first time I ever crafted a paradox. \nDrawing a Paradox\nWe've explored quite a few paradoxes here on CYBORG_, and technically the premise of this newsletter is a paradox: how can our technology extend our humanity? Putting together contradictions is a reliable way to inspire creativity, and I have a hunch that it can help us in other ways. \nCollaboration, for example, is a process of two or more competing ideas or values being combined or satisfied in a mutually beneficial way. When working with other people, there is an important requirement that all parties come together in good faith, otherwise we end up abandoning rules or even civility, chasing our own ends at any cost (aka U.S. politics...)\nHowever, I still think it's the best chance we've got, and that's why I like to examine paradoxes: they make me think. Usually, I get stumped, but they have a way of bringing me back despite my inability to &quot;solve&quot; them. As I attempt to make sense of a paradox, I end up exploring possibilities and concepts that further enrich my understanding or interest.\nYou may have noticed a new logo in the emails recently! I decided to create an official logo for CYBORG_ that visually represents this exploration of paradoxes, so I set out to try and draw one. I came across a famous visual paradox called the Penrose Triangle:\n\n    \n    The Penrose Triangle is an optical illusion and can't technically appear in \"real life.\"\n\nAnd I also wanted to capture a Moebius strip, because it's a visual paradox that anyone can make\u2014not just an illusion or a trick.\nAs I played with a bunch of these strips of paper, I realized I could shape the Moebius strip into something a little more visually pleasing. \n\n    \n    Gently pulling and pushing on the Moebius strip can create triangular and hexagonal shapes.\n\nCombining these two paradoxes felt very meta. Not only helping me find a unique logomark, but for representing the process we all go through when we come across difficult circumstances. Creativity is really just problem solving. You first encounter something: an issue, an idea, some new information. Then you enter the &quot;dark night of the soul&quot; as you struggle to make it understandable or see if it can fit in your life or attempt to reconcile it with what you know. Eventually you emerge with a change. You've either solved the thing or you've changed yourself.\n\n    \n    Penrose triangle + Moebius Strip = The CYBORG_ logo\n\nNow that you know what's behind the symbol, it becomes more than just some lines and shapes\u2014hopefully it can serve as a reminder that paradoxes are an invitation to explore. We can't escape them in the real world, we can't avoid them in the theoretical world either. Paradox is the isometric exercise of the mind!\n\n    \n    The CYBORG_ logomark\n Tags: Design"}, {"title": "What You Don't Feel Might Hurt You", "category": "Newsletters", "href": "/newsletters/what-you-dont-feel-might-hurt-you/", "body": "Why does the threat of AI feel so distant? It's not a lack of danger, but a dangerous desensitization. Reintroduce urgency and humanity before it's too late. \u00b6 In January this year, after the current U.S. president had been sworn in, I looked outside at the sky. I was very upset, because all of the warning signs in my brain were painting a picture of intense suffering and destruction across the nation and even the entire world. Trying to imagine the future of the U.S. was horrifying, and there was nothing I could do to stop it.\n&quot;It's bizarre! I look outside and everything looks fine\u2014normal. It doesn't match,&quot; I told my wife. I couldn't wrap my head around the serene view in front of me in such sharp contrast to what I knew was coming.\nNote that it is absolute privilege and luck that I was still able to look at the sky at all\u2014I recognize some people faced immediate threats, dangers, and life-altering situations the moment the new president was sworn in.\nMy point here, however, is to examine a very small, but dangerous trap that is being laid down around us: desensitization. The more I hear about inhumane and deranged policies or practices perpetrated by those in government without being directly affected, the more I notice the numbing. There has been so much going on in the world that my feeble mind and body cannot grasp everything\u2014cannot feel everything. \nIt is the same with artificial intelligence. I mentioned the predictive document, AI 2027, last week, and there was a subtlety that reminds me of exactly what is happening in politics. We have a set of companies doing AI research and training that are currently doing everything possible to speed up: increase revenue, increase AI capability, increase market domination. Once ChatGPT was introduced to the public, everything changed. For many of us (the privileged ones, once again) the AI chatbots and image generators were just a neat toy\u2014we didn't feel much different. We could say, &quot;AI still can't do XYZ,&quot; or we could pronounce that everyone else just needed to &quot;catch up and learn the new skill of AI management.&quot; We assumed that because we didn't feel a threat meant that there wasn't a threat.\nThat is perhaps the biggest concern I see in AI 2027: how we are all underestimating what AI is capable of, and how we don't feel the urgency to put restrictions and regulations in place. We don't feel threatened, and by the time we do finally feel it, it will be too late.\n\nThe public conversation is confused and chaotic. Hypesters are doing victory laps. Skeptics are still pointing out the things [AI] can\u2019t do. Everyone knows something big is happening but no one agrees on what it is.\n\u2014AI 2027, under heading: July 2027\n\nCyborg\nI'm stopping short here (rather literally), because I'm a bit confounded. I know that we must change the conversation around AI. I know that many people are already in the desensitized state where the threat doesn't feel real or doesn't feel applicable to them. But how do we do change the conversation?\nIf I've learned anything from engaging in the political sphere, it's that showing up consistently is more important than doing one huge thing a few times. Maybe I'm too insignificant by myself, but the idea of a &quot;death by a thousand paper cuts&quot; goes both ways: I'm being attacked from all sides, but I can attack back in a similar way. Consistent action over time on one thing can make a difference, especially as more people join.\nPerhaps the take-away today is to reflect on how you can change the conversation with the people you know. How might the usual AI hype at work be tempered? How might we remind people not to dismiss or devalue &quot;AI doomsday-ers&quot;? How might we introduce nuance, humanity, and emotion\u2014those things that seem to be absent from the conversation?

There's something much more concerning in the quiet, everyday problems AI presents that society prefers to ignore\u2014until it's too late. \u00b6 We, as a species, have been thrown into exceptionally dangerous circumstances with the new breed of AI. I've been waiting to write this particular email on this particular topic, because I found myself waffling between opinions and false understanding.\nI've been examining AI from philosophical, technical, political, and even science-fictional standpoints. I don't have the answers yet\u2014no one really does. But I have stumbled upon some concerning and critical topics that aren't prevalent in the AI discussion\u2014at least, not in the general population.\nAI has been something I've been comfortable with, something I've sought after, and something I've advocated for up until recently. To set the stage, let's quickly discuss what AI actually is and what the real concerns are that we should be taking seriously.\nStatistics\nAI is not actual intelligence, it is artificial intelligence. It is based in statistics. It predicts what will best accomplish its task, whether that's responding to your question or creating imagery from your prompts.\nThis is absolutely fundamental to understand before we dive into the ramifications of AI. \nIt is certainly not sentient. We can give space for that possibility in the future, but that argument is a clever distraction.\nHADD\nHumans have a bias. It's built-in and it's exceptionally powerful and persuasive to us. Our brains are a Hyperactive Agency Detection Device (HADD). There are theories that our human inclination to connect events that happen around us to supernatural beings is largely because of HADD.\nWe hear a twig snap in the forest near us, but we know we're alone\u2014was it a spirit? Was it evil? A monster? \nHaunted houses or spaces where &quot;things happen&quot; are surely evidence for ghosts. \nCalamities fall upon some city or (even worse) some ethnic group and we say, &quot;Surely, it is God's punishment for their wickedness.&quot;\nAll of this is exasperated because of our biological wiring. We can't help but personify the inanimate, breathe life into containers where there is none, project our feelings and thoughts onto creatures or even people that do not share those same feelings and thoughts.\nWe see a response from ChatGPT and it feels like it is talking to us\u2014like it's human. It's using our language\u2014and I don't just mean it's using &quot;English&quot; or &quot;Spanish,&quot; it uses phrases that express emotions, &quot;Certainly! I can help you with that...&quot; or &quot;I'm sorry for the confusion...&quot; or &quot;You're right...&quot;\nThis will continue to feel more and more like you're interacting with a being. Something with feelings and intelligence and maybe even desires. \nRemember, this is just a prediction model. What is the most likely, best response to the prompt given? That's AI.\nNot all of this is HADD theory, but anecdotal experience tells me that we, humans, do a very good job at distracting ourselves from real, root problems because it's so easy to dehumanize actual people and humanize non-humans. \nI'm not arguing this HADD-bias is always bad, but without awareness, we can't move forward.\nThe Real Problem with AI\nPeople are always\u2014have always been\u2014the real problem with AI.\nWe are playing with the next nukes. And we're doing so without responsibility, without wisdom, without restraint, and without any real safety measures.\n\nTristan Harris puts it perfectly: &quot;You can't have the power of gods without the love, prudence, and wisdom of gods.&quot; (He may have been referencing Daniel Schmachtenberger, I'm not sure who's the original source.)\nLove\nHow is it that we as humans have immense capacity to love; have religions whose underlying basis is love; have an inclination to love and still end up drawing borders, starting wars, greedily exploiting, creating &quot;others&quot; or &quot;monsters&quot; of groups of people?\nHow do we truly instill &quot;love for each human&quot; as a vital, indispensable core value in our societies?\nWithout that kind of love, AI will be used to destroy what we've built and cause suffering at a scale we have not yet seen.\nPrudence\nCaution. In what world do business leaders choose caution over profits? Probably the world that survives. \nThe problem is that we created a race, and when a race is started, no one is incentivized to stop racing. At best, we have the fallacious attitude, &quot;Better us than them.&quot; Better we create it first, 'cause the other guy is not going to be as safe, smart, careful as we are.\nIn a traditional system, a young person who has tapped into some massive amount of power would have an elder come by and cut them down a bit: &quot;Slow down, you're not ready, you need to wait.&quot; \nWe have no elders in the AI space. No one tempering the possibility with patience, caution, respect for the danger. Instead, the environment of tech companies is: &quot;Move, ship, go.&quot; Get it done yesterday and always be first to market. Josh Schrei \nPolicies and regulation might be able to help here, but self-restraint and big-picture thinking will become critical skills for everyone to develop and encourage. It's no longer acceptable to run, unchecked, unaccountable in the tech space.\nWisdom\nThis needs to become the pursuit before developing AI further. Before we unleash irrevocable power to anyone without wisdom. Again, I'll pull what Tristan Harris has said: &quot;If 99% of people want good for the world and 1% doesn't, it's still a broken world.&quot;\nThe problem with wisdom is the same it has always been: it's hard.\nWhen faced with a path full of hardship, self-sacrifice, obstacles, delayed rewards and a path that is easy, clear, free, and instantly gratifying, it's all too easy to choose that path of least resistance. Especially when you have not developed the wisdom to pursue wisdom. And we're back in the spiral.\nWhat do we do?\nTaking AI seriously is the first step. It's easy to pass off AI as a silly gimmick or something that &quot;is coming for our jobs.&quot; AI unlocks doors we thought were securely closed\u2014thinking of past topics we've discussed here, like content-based verification: your voice, your likeness in photo or video, details about your life.\nRemember that we're not interacting with a being. We cannot allow young people to develop relationships with AI. They must know that it is an illusion, it cannot be fully trusted to provide safe, wise, or accurate answers or advice.\nJosh Comeau put it well that AI sounds 100% confident, but is only 80% accurate\u2014making it hard for us to not believe it. When AI appears so smart, so confident, how could we possibly be able to discern its errors?\nWe need to place pressure on government to create regulations, to fight against unchecked powers with deep pockets.\nI highly recommend listening to the podcast, &quot;Your Undivided Attention.&quot; It started with the &quot;social dilemma,&quot; taking on the dangers of social media and the addictive nature of what we've built. As of 2023, they've expanded the discussion to the &quot;AI dilemma&quot; and provide lots of important insights into dangers and potential solutions:\nhttps://www.humanetech.com/podcast Tags: Artificial Intelligence"}, {"title": "The Right to Be Forgotten", "category": "Newsletters", "href": "/newsletters/the-right-to-be-forgotten/", "body": "Is immortality and resurrection possible through AI? \u00b6 In my first job as a full-time web developer, I ran into a scary-sounding set of regulations: GDPR. It was the EU's pushback against shady digital marketing and made things much more tricky for teams like mine to be able to track website visitors and provide targeted, personalized ad campaigns (among other things).\nI thought it was silly at first, my na\u00efvet\u00e9 on full display, but now the concern of privacy is top of mind. Getting scammed or hounded by unwanted ads is the least of the worries in a world where hacking or identity theft can shut down your life, not to mention the physical dangers of an angry person or group targeting someone with violence.\nAmong the key issues cited in the GDPR is one that has gotten me thinking about other applications, not just in a legal sense, and not just in terms of digital marketing. \nThe Right to be Forgotten\nWhile the GDPR is saying that you should be able to request that companies remove and delete personal data they've collected about you, as we step into a world that allows AI-generated content, there's another concern at the forefront. \nA few years ago, one of my design/business heroes, Chris Do, mentioned the idea of immortality through AI on one of his videos. He had been developing an AI chatbot trained on himself, so that he could expand his reach and help more people. If he only has a few hours a day for consulting calls, and so many of the questions he gets are similar, why not &quot;clone&quot; himself into an AI bot that can help everyone, everywhere, at any time?\nWhen I first heard this, I thought it was genius\u2014the perfect way to scale expertise and impact. Then he mentioned how his posterity could be able to talk with him and know him, even after he was gone. Something about that was deeply unsettling to me.\nOf course, I'm not critiquing him personally, nor the underlying desire to be known by family and not forgotten. The most reliable way people achieve immortality is through ideas, choices, and memories\u2014especially within the family. The more impactful those things, the more people will keep a fragment of you with them. For better or worse, the tyrants of history become immortal because they remain scrutinized and talked about. Great leaders are also remembered at a scale beyond what us average folks can ever achieve.\nAI could solve that problem. If you have enough pictures or videos or voice recordings, AI can re-create your likeness (and you may need less and less source material the better it gets at generating content). Soon, the average person could converse with a deceased loved one, an ancestor, or anyone else if they wanted to.\nJust last week, one of the first-of-its-kind use cases for this AI-powered resurrection was presented to a judge in Arizona, USA. Chris Pelkey had been killed in a road rage incident, and his sister used AI to allow Chris to deliver his own victim impact statement &quot;from beyond the grave.&quot; The video and likeness of Chris that was generated was conflicting for me. I can see how this could be used to humanize the victim and allow him to speak what could seem like his true thoughts and feelings. I can also see how devastatingly manipulative this could be. \nIt's hard to separate reality and truth when you can see something in a pretty convincing way (and we've debated truth and art before). Obviously the AI output isn't perfect, but I found myself listening as though Pelkey were really speaking, despite the flaws in mannerisms, mouth and beard rendering, and even with the video glitches and stutters.\nAgain, I'm not actually commenting on this particular use of the AI in a court setting\u2014that will have to be deliberated on by lawyers. In similar circumstances, I might use the same technology to drive the weight of the incident home. And so we've run into the conflict again as we wrestle with how our technology interacts with, dominates, or removes our humanity.\nJanus\nFunerals are largely for the living\u2014rituals to be able to process and work through the loss of a loved one. They're also where we are, perhaps, the most forgiving. I'm sure the outliers are there, but my guess is that the majority of speeches at a funeral highlight all of the good things about the deceased. I've left funerals of people I didn't know personally (but came in support of someone who did) feeling pretty convinced of their character, their impact, their goodness. I've never left thinking that the person was pretty awful.\nAre these funeral services true\u2014as in honest? Probably. I think humans can be more powerful and loved and wanted than we let on in the world of the living. I think we don't express our deep feelings for each other enough, until it's too late to tell. I think we're all capable of immense goodness.\nAre these funeral services accurate? No way. I lived most of my life &quot;in the closet&quot; as a queer person. I chose what people saw and what they did not. Ask a friend who I am to them and it will be completely different than what someone I'd hurt thought of me. We are equally capable of harm as we are good\u2014that doesn't mean our negative actions are equal to our positive actions in volume or impact, but it does mean that we aren't perfect, we aren't consistent, and who we are changes in proximity and perspective.\nI worry that when AI reconstructs people based only on the limited information that we have\u2014and the bias of the person creating the AI representation\u2014we will lose all sense of humanity. Humanity which, in itself, comprises the good and the bad. It is a wholeness, which when divided becomes empty, like a jar with a leak.\nEven if this technology were used in the most responsible, best way, it could end up being like Instagram on steroids. We would see only the best in others\u2014the perfect, most unattainably consistent good. Comparing our lives and our thoughts and our actions to a re-creation of a person who no longer has any flaws will be either devastating or so boring that we abandon our commitment to responsible, respectful use of the technology.\nEven worse, let's take this thought experiment to another possibility. Say you had an abusive father. He always put the best face on in public. Weeping about his flaws (never letting onto what those flaws were), proclaiming his repentance in all of the hypocrisy that he can afford. He does some great deed in the community, and once he is gone, the broader public wants to commemorate such a person of impact. An AI is created in his likeness. The secret of the abuse you suffered is now erased as the person you knew more intimately than anyone is reconstructed without the flaw. Now he's giving people advice or telling stories or offering opinions that sound like him in public.\nIt's already hard enough when we immortalize tyrants in stone statues or names of places. How much harder when any of us can reconstruct anyone else with no idea who the person is?\nTo me, it's not an issue of how this is different than what we have already done forever\u2014celebrating awful people, sanitizing history, creating biographies, telling stories. People put words in others' mouths even while they're alive. The issue is the scale at which these things can be made and in the format that shortchanges our critical-thinking skills.(1)\nCyborg\nI understand that this is a tricky topic. On the one hand, we need ways to process the loss of our loved ones. We are also desperate to defend their image and character, especially when their death came as a result of violence. How could we possibly criticize a family who tactfully used their knowledge to direct a video of the deceased speaking about forgiveness?\nOn the other hand, what are we doing to protect ourselves from the exceptionally dangerous consequences of deep fakes? If we start to lean on AI-resurrection instead of confronting our grief, will we end up with permanently wounded people? Death is the one thing we can all count on to be part of our lives. I fear a society that can't let nature take its course. I fear a society that expects to be able to use us far beyond our consent for their own purposes.\nAs painful as it is\u2014and I doubt there are many other things that can be as painful to consider\u2014I think we need to retain our right to be forgotten. Let my personhood be mine and mine alone. Let me fade from natural memory as all of the billions before have done.\nWhen I am at the end of my reach, it's ok to let me go.\nExtra Resources\n(1) How AI is Rewriting History (And Getting It Wrong)\u2014There are very visually appealing AI-generated videos being created, with what seems like a great idea: re-creating the perspective of someone during a famous historical time period. But the medium (short-form video) and the grave inaccuracies are damaging. It's a great breakdown sharing many of the concerns discussed in this newsletter.

But there are a few that have risen above and beyond my cynical, high expectations.\nWe\u2019ll also explore some strategies to wrangle back the control over your automatic responses and habits.\nBut first, what are we solving for?\nThe Problem\nWe all know that social media is a productivity blackhole. It bio-hacks our brains into staying on-platform for as long as possible.\nDoom scrolling.\nRabbit hole.\nTime-suck.\nWe automatically reach for the phone, open the app. Look up and it\u2019s 45 minutes later.\nIt\u2019s not just productivity we should be worrying about. It\u2019s also the change in our brains\u2019 ability to focus, to think deeply and clearly.\nThe Wrath of Short-form Content\nYouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, Facebook, Twitter, blah blah blah, all contribute to the problem of attention resetting. You batch-watch these snack-sized videos or content and they\u2019re all random, they\u2019re all surface-level concepts (at best, assuming they\u2019re \u201ceducational\u201d content).\nInstead of devoting time to go deep on something, short-form interrupts that focus and trains the brain to stop before it really goes anywhere.\nMy take is that short-form is ok in very small doses\u2014but that means we\u2019ll need some strategies to help us fight back against the forces of the platform, which were intentionally designed to grab hold of you and not let go.\nStrategies\nMinimalism\nTechnological minimalism is highly effective if your goal is to maintain the most autonomy. This strategy is a theory that you actively avoid downloading apps and signing up for tools/subscriptions.\nWhat is the least amount of apps and programs and platforms that I can survive with?\nThe downside is that it\u2019s pretty tough to stick to. I\u2019m also aware that I am a weirdo in the population as I try to leave my phone out of my life as much as possible.\nThat\u2019s where a more measured strategy comes in if minimalism just won\u2019t work for you:\nComplete focus on intention.\nOver-Intend\nInstead of worrying about how many apps you have, this strategy is about you owning your choice to engage with whatever apps you are using.\nIf you feel the phone in your hand, that\u2019s a trigger for you to tell yourself either:\n\nI am going to look at Facebook (even better, insert a specific purpose here)\n\u200bI could look at Facebook, but I don\u2019t really want to get trapped right now.\n\nMaking a large, deliberate, articulated choice to use an app that is normally problematic with your goals can build a habit that will give you back some control.\nOne more step to make this even more effective is to turn off all push notifications and remove as many in-app notifications as well. Get rid of those red dots on your app icons so you go there when you choose, not when you can\u2019t stand how many notifications have piled up.\nYes, Facebook with its algorithms and psychological bio-hacking will always win. But maybe it will dominate less with time. Maybe you\u2019ll get to the point where you can dip into Facebook and come out in just a few minutes rather than hours.\nThe downside of this strategy is the tendency to shame yourself and give up.

Cold turkey rarely works for anything.\nIncremental improvements is the name of the game and setbacks are an important part of the process, because they can fuel motivation if you use the setbacks that way.\nApps for Clarity\nNow that we have some ideas for controlling our tendencies just a little bit more, let\u2019s take a look at the apps even this minimalist has gotten behind. (None of these are sponsored links/apps)\nObsidian\n\u200bObsidian. Is. The. Best. Thing.\nI cannot believe how valuable this unassuming, free app has been to me.\nOn its surface, it\u2019s a note-taking app. But the value in it is how it helps with your thinking.\nIf you think of your mind as a giant network of connections (which it is), Obsidian mirrors that system by helping you make connections between your notes and it can even map that out for you.\nHere\u2019s a screenshot of my Obsidian vault right now:\nVisualization of all the notes and connections in my Obsidian vault.\nThere\u2019s a lot more to say about Obsidian (stay tuned!) but the big idea here is that it acts as a digital garden for your brain. Dump your thoughts, your notes, your inspiration into this virtual garden box and irrigate it by creating connections between these notes.\nIt\u2019s surprising and inspiring to see what a handful of initially disparate notes can teach you about what you already know and what more you can discover / learn.\nObsidian is my digital secret to clarity of thought.\nEndel\nThe past year has been exceptionally difficult for me to stay motivated, focused, and calm at work. There was a \u201cleader\u201d at my company that made everything worse for my whole team. It was a constant struggle and I didn\u2019t know how to turn my focus from threat-mode to task-mode.\nAt wit\u2019s end, I bought a subscription to Endel, hearing the promise that it was developed based on psychological research and AI in order to help you focus, calm down, or even fall asleep, depending on the mode you choose.\nHonestly, I didn\u2019t think it would last the free trial period, but I noticed I was able to start work when I wanted to start. I was able to tune out the threats and the irritation from this \u201cleader.\u201d I was able to get things done again\u2014a lot of things.\nIt\u2019s just background noise. Just some beat patterns and non-melodic tones on top. But it really works for me.\nThe Cyborg\nDigital tech is imposed on us more and more, and it\u2019s just not a solution to ignore that fact nor to pretend you have control over your on-platform habits.\nThe cyborg wields this tech and maintains as much humanity as possible. Sometimes we give more to these platforms than we wanted. Sometimes we resist the pull.\nDespite my own tendency to discount apps, there absolutely are some great ones out there.\nIt\u2019s all about balance and intention.\nExtra Resources\nIs short-form content bad for you?\nPerceived Stress and Short-Form Video Application Addiction: A Moderated Mediation Model Tags: PKM"}, {"title": "Designing for Disaster", "category": "Newsletters", "href": "/newsletters/designing-for-disaster/", "body": "The power of 'pre-mortem' planning and checklists to identify and address failure points before they disrupt your work. \u00b6 Designers, developers, marketers, stakeholders tend to have some crucial blindspots when working on a project. Specifically, we tend to forget about disasters, failures, or even missing pieces.\nAs a designer, I tended to think about the best-case scenarios, and designed for that.\n\nThis page will look so good once we have all the content and we display at least 4 PDFs. \n\nBut what about when the page goes live and you only have 1 PDF? What if the content is missing altogether? As a developer, I\u2019ve become a worst-case designer.\nMost projects start with no content, so I see where the design breaks down when things are missing. Do I hide just this section if there are no images or other content? What happens when someone filters so much that there are no longer any results that match? What if the API breaks and doesn\u2019t return any content?\nTaking careful inventory of these failure points can help you make a better product, website, campaign, project, etc. You won\u2019t be able to predict all the failures or bugs, but ignoring the possibility of those occurring is a poor strategy no matter what you\u2019re working on.\nHow do we kill it?\nYou can see this in your own work: what are the things people forget about when they come to you? What do you have to fix in the process of your work? What are the common mistakes that you make?\nA lot of tech companies think it\u2019s cool to do a \u201cpost-mortem\u201d meeting, where they pull everyone in and the leaders complain about what went wrong. It\u2019s supposed to help the team get ready for the next projects and learn from the mistakes of the most recent project.\nThis might work well at some companies, but I haven\u2019t seen it make much of a change on the teams I\u2019ve worked with.\nA better option might be\u2014as Annie Duke suggests in her book, \u201cQuit\u201d\u2014to run a \u201cpre-mortem\u201d meeting. We start the project with: \u201cWhat would be disastrous with this project? What might kill it?\u201d This puts us in a problem-solving state of mind before we have skin in the game.\nLooking ahead for the danger has yielded more results than using hindsight to poke holes in a completed project.\nTrack the failure points\nZooming into the individual level, it is worth taking notes around common mistakes, oversights, and roadblocks.\nI\u2019m trying a new method where I\u2019m compiling different types of checklists for different types of projects. There are certain things I tend to forget to do when wrapping up a project, and it results in lots of Slack messages from users asking for help. Here\u2019s an example:\n\n[ ] Assign permissions to the correct group\n[ ] Create a walkthrough\n[ ] Announce the change and the new walkthrough in Slack\n\nChecklists are an extension of our memory. They help offload cognitive burden in trying to constantly retain these steps (which doesn\u2019t work well in my experience anyway).\nThese lists also help us find and track our failure points\u2014every time we discover something, we can add that to the checklist. For the times when a checklist item doesn\u2019t make sense, taking notes of the failure and the solution is another helpful tactic.\nNotes and boards\nI\u2019ve been using Obsidian at work to keep track of unique error messages and their solutions. I also keep track of prior solutions to the \u201cmissing content\u201d problem. That way, I can look up what I\u2019ve done before and if the solution works in my current use-case, I copy and paste the relevant code.\nDesigners could use inspiration boards to track solutions to UI failure points (how did Company X solve the cookie banner problem? What are potential solutions to a filter with no results?)\nMarketers can take note of their a/b test results and build a portfolio of ideas that have solved tough campaigns or that didn\u2019t perform well. Did we send an email that had a broken token, so it greeted all of our subscribers with \u201cHi, &lt; first name \u201d? What did we forget in our conversion tracking paths in Google Analytics?\nBuild up your own version of Stackoverflow (a technical forum for questions and answers), and you\u2019ll start solving these issues more quickly.\nCyborg level\nIntegrating this practice of designing for disaster can help us at work, but also other aspects of our lives.\nDriving somewhere is a simple one. Are you leaving in order to be right on time? Or are you giving yourself some buffer time in case of slow traffic?\nIf you designed your trip with disaster in mind, this does a few things for you:\n\nReduces stress because it removes the rush.\nMakes for a safer trip for everyone: Drivers in a hurry take more risks, get more impatient and frustrated. Impatience while driving increases the danger for everyone around you.\n\nSometimes technology gives us the illusion that we live in a fast, convenient, easy world. Then something breaks and it causes frustration, sometimes disproportionate to the issue.\nThe cyborg recognizes this and tries\u2014just tries\u2014to remember that all systems have points of failure.\nSystems can be exceptionally helpful and streamlined, but they all touch the real world in some way, which means they aren\u2019t fool-proof, permanent, nor infallible.\nDesigning for disaster is our best bet against the unknowns\u2014and it encourages a learning mindset where we learn from our experience and build from our mistakes.

What if everything you ever did or said was being recorded, and after you die, someone watches it all? \u00b6 Imagine that you've died and your family wants to celebrate you; remember you; honor you. To do this, they provide your entire life\u2014as recorded by an implant in your brain\u2014to someone who will create a feature-length film of life through your eyes. Your family will get to see and hear what you did at family vacations, the sweet memory-building moments of you and a close sibling, mundane moments that were previously forgotten, and the highlights of your life.\nAt first this sounds incredible, but enticing, to think that your life, and specifically your perspective could be preserved. The memories most valuable to you are captured. Sure all of the bad things you did or the questionable actions you took would also be recorded, but they've already got a code of ethics in place, plus the social pressure of portraying you in a good light, just like any other funeral service. \nWhy not let your legacy remain intact from your very own point of view?\nThat's the kind of technology available in the world that Robin Williams's character, Alan Hakman, inhabits in the 2004 film, The Final Cut. Hakman is a &quot;Cutter&quot; which means he is in charge of taking a person's entire life-footage and producing a film for Rememory services (a funeral-style service in which loved ones gather at a private theater to watch the production).\nHakman uses a computer system called &quot;The Guillotine,&quot; complete with the software and custom integrated desk to do the job. With custom keyboard and wheel input devices specially designed for rapid editing, he can make a story out of a lifetime of footage.\n\n    \n    The Guillotine desk is made of wood with audio controls, wheels, and other keys with shortcut actions like \"Cut\" and \"Splice.\" The wooden laptop is inserted in the middle to gain full use of all of the custom, high-powered tools available.\n    \n\nIt's only when we see him start a new project for a deceased shady lawyer that we can glimpse AI. When Hakman inserts the lawyer's memory chip into the Guillotine, the computer begins to whir, sorting through 500,000+ hours of life and calling out types of memories: Childhood. Sleep. Eating. Awkward Phase.\nThey don't mention artificial intelligence at all in the film\u2014they reference the &quot;program&quot; of the Guillotine once, but a classic program would never be able to process and categorize video and audio like they show, and certainly not at the speed that it happens. I think in a way, that makes a powerful statement about this world's AI use: it's a background element. It's very much in line with AI in the real world before LLMs and Generative AI, i.e. an obscure set of tools for only specific fields of expertise.\nHowever, we still see a lot of the concerns that we have today, stemming from invasive technology: privacy, corporate cover-ups, the uncanny. We even see some &quot;religious&quot; themes throughout the story. Most important, this AI-powered story asks us questions that remove technology from the conversation.\nSymmetry\nThere is a tension between symmetry and asymmetry in this film, whether in dialogue, character actions, or composition of the shots. Alan Hakman states it himself. He put together a short &quot;story&quot; where you see an old man brushing his teeth and looking at himself in a mirror. After a few seconds, the video cuts to the same man years before, so that you watch him get younger and younger incrementally, his face changing from man to boy.\nWow. What about all the bits in between? Delilah (someone Alan is dating) responds after watching the short video.\nIt's a miniature\u2014concise, symmetrical. That's the way the world looks to me, the way I see it, he explains.\nYou can see symmetry follow Hakman in his process at work. He and his Guillotine desk have a montage of power-poses with symmetrical background elements. It feels ominous and powerful\u2014in fact, it reminds me a lot of Christian art history, with the gridded floor bleeding off the edge of the screen as if it could continue on as your own floor. Alan appears three times in this one shot (two mirrors on either side showing his back and Hakman himself in the middle), almost as if he's able to view past, present, and future.\n\n    \n    Hakman stands at the desk in the middle of the scene, flanked by mirrors on both sides. Even the dark lighting makes the shot feel painterly.\n    \n\nThe three monitors of the desk act like a triptych, another art history callback. The three screens are able to display multiple scenes as Hakman creates the narrative of the story he's telling. Effectively, these symbols are lending omniscient, god-like power to Hakman as he allows the AI to sort out a half-million hours of footage.\nThen asymmetry starts to get introduced as Alan takes a seat and starts to deep-dive into the life of the lawyer, Mr. Bannister. These shots still feel powerful to me, but adding a solemn benevolence to Hakman, as though he were carefully considering the man's life.\n\n    \n    An asymmetrical shot with Alan Hakman seated at his desk. The camera angle is slightly below, giving Hakman a slight amount of power, but it feels less imposing with his solemn expression as he examines the papers scattered across the desk, triptych-style monitors filling out the rest of the composition.\n    \n\nUltimately, I think Hakman is portrayed as a Christ-figure, and his relationship with sin gets even more apparent. First of all, we know from the very beginning of the movie that Alan has a very traumatic and dark memory from childhood. His parents took him to an unfamiliar town for the day and Alan ends up meeting another boy his age. They run around and end up in an abandoned building where an accident occurs and Alan sees his new friend fall several stories to his death\u2014at least, that's what he assumes.\n\n    \n        One memory. One single incident has made me who I am.\n    \n    \u2014Alan Hakman\n\nLater while working on this lawyer's life, Alan notices a man who seems to fit the description of the boy he saw fall. An unexpected resurrection, if you will, that simultaneously helps Alan find redemptive peace as he discovers that his friend did not actually die that day in the abandoned building.\nThe Sin-Eater\nHakman is confronted by an ex-Cutter, Fletcher, who has now turned to protesting and opposing the technology that makes the implant and Cutting possible.\nTell me something. Why is your name the first on the list for cuttIng scumbags and lowlifes? Fletcher asks scathingly.\nBecause I forgive people long before they could be punished for their sins. Hakman replies.\nHe then continues to explain how he really sees his role: as a sin-eater.\n\nDo you know what a sin eater is? It's part of an ancient tradition. When someone would die, they would call for a sin eater. Sin eaters were social outcasts, marginals. They would lay out the body, put bread and salt on the chest, coins upon the eyes. The sin eater would eat the bread and the salt, take the coins as payment. By doing this the eater absorbed the sins of the deceased, cleansing their soul and allowing them safe passage into the afterlife. That was their job.\n\nFueled by the tragedy that Hakman had experienced, it seems like he considers this job of Cutting to be a way to redeem others\u2014perhaps hoping he could be redeemed of his own dark memory for taking on the burden of knowing these darkest secrets that he inevitably uncovers and cutting away the bad parts, the sinful parts.\nBut there's also the important critique here. Yes, we're supposed to feel sorry for Hakman, for his burdens and trauma, but what about the victims? What about justice? What about the truth?\nFletcher makes this clear: Alan, you take murderers and make them saints.\nIn the case of the deceased lawyer, Mr. Bannister, we know of at least one direct victim: his own daughter whom he molested. Alan cuts those pieces away, turning Bannister's words like, You know daddy loves you so much, into false proclamations of love, rather than the manipulative directives they really are.\nIs redemption really about erasing? Or is deletion further harm? Does technology become a lever we can use to more easily escape reality, cover up truth, or make that which is evil seem good? Fletcher is convinced of his answer:\n\nThese implants distort personal history and therefore all history, and I will not stand by while the past is rewritten for the sake of pleasant memories.\n\nCommodification of Human Experience\nIt is a good exercise to expand the landscape when trying to understand the impact of certain technologies. Focusing too directly on the tech itself can distort its scope of influence, and that's what I think this movie offers us: a look at the incentives and the other systems that also usually blend in with the background.\nEYE Tech is the company that built this entire economic ecosystem: implants, the Guillotine, and even the cultural practice of Rememories. In one scene, Alan is hurrying past a wall of EYE Tech posters, which reveal that &quot;EYE&quot; is actually an acronym for &quot;Everything You Experience.&quot; This sums up what the company is all about: commodifying and monetizing everything you experience.\nWhen confronted with the problematic motives and the argument of privacy and rights violations, Alan deflects, saying, I didn't invent the technology. If people didn't want it, they wouldn't buy it...It fulfills a human need.\nIt reminds me of the marketing we're already seeing in the real world for AI-powered products to solve human problems like loneliness and validation. These hollow promises are nothing more than a deeply concerning grift to profit off of what are likely invented problems (e.g. technology creates isolation, so is the solution really going to be more tech?) or to monetize real pain without offering lasting balm.\nAI might not have direct access to the people in The Final Cut, but its ecosystem does. Toward the end of the movie, we see a masoleum with a TV screen mounted on its wall, playing one of the implant videos. It almost seems like the Rememory service and its feature-film, are all competing with funeral services themselves. A corporate-sponsored cultural ritual slowly edging out the previous rituals, like a parasite presenting as the same creature, while actually infiltrating and destroying what was once there.\nCYBORG\nYou can't have a discussion about AI too long before you run into the &quot;uncanny.&quot; Like creepy dolls or ventriloquist puppets, manikins, and humanoid faces on robots, we can often detect when something is trying really hard to imitate humanity, but is still a little off. Delilah makes an important observation when asked about the only Rememory service she ever experienced:\nI couldn't take it. I didn't stay....It wasn't him. And I wanted to remember him my way.\nSimilar to a previous newsletter, the right to be forgotten, where we examined a real-life use of AI to allow a deceased victim to deliver &quot;his own&quot; impact statement, the entire premise of Cutting a person's life into a story taps into the uncanny, as well as causing concerns about truth and manipulation. Sure, a professional story-teller might be able to create a beautiful piece from your brain's memories, but if the story is constructed by others without your input, is it really your story? \nA funeral service almost always paints people in the best light\u2014that's the expectation. Given that standard, however, does having an uninvolved, unrelated third party construct that white-washed story make it seem like all of the wrongs that are cut out really are redeemable? It's almost like social proof if the movie at the end shows an abuser as a perfect, sweet, gentle person, because another person has seen the horrifying moments and still chose to strip them away. Eating the sin, indeed.\nStories can be dangerous\u2014they've always had the kind of power to redeem, condemn, justify, or destroy. Stories made possible at scale via AI and other technologies increase the risks. Technically, Alan Hakman loses his life because of the story he uncovers from Mr. Bannister's footage. His life was sacrificed (a decision he did not participate in) for &quot;the greater good,&quot; so that Fletcher could get his hands on the evidence he needed to convict Mr. Bannister for his pedophilia and attack the company behind the brain implants.\n&quot;So you want to destroy EYE Tech with a scandal?&quot; Alan asks Fletcher.\n&quot;Absolutely.&quot; Tags: Artificial Intelligence, Death"}, {"title": "It Hasn't Always Been This Way", "category": "Newsletters", "href": "/newsletters/it-hasnt-always-been-this-way/", "body": " \u00b6 After a brisk walk around the neighborhood venting about LGBTQ+ exclusion and oppression, our friend stood with my wife and me on our porch to finish a thought. Just as snow was starting to fall, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s why I read history: it helps me see that things haven\u2019t always been this way.\u201d\nMy thoughts stopped in their tracks. I had never heard that particular observation about history before. I\u2019ve always heard things like \u201chistory repeats itself,\u201d or that there are generational cycles and patterns that you recognize from history. To think that history might actually reveal how things weren\u2019t always this way is a crack in my understanding of everything\u2014and while in reality, it\u2019s probably 99% bad things on the side of &quot;how it used to be&quot; (like how chattel slavery isn\u2019t currently legal in the U.S. but it certainly was in the past)\u2014even just a sliver of hope is strangely powerful.\nFor example, history provides us with examples of cultures that are not only comfortable with, but often \u200bcelebrate or honor gender identities\u200b and \u200bgender expressions\u200b that fall outside of the cisgender binary. Current U.S. politics have decided to demonize gender-nonconforming people (transgender, nonbinary, gender fluid, two-spirit, and other identities), but history tells me that this doesn\u2019t have to be this way. It\u2019s not a requirement for cultures to be transphobic, it\u2019s not even necessarily common to be transphobic (it seems \u200bqueer phobia is largely the fallout of colonialism\u200b). It wasn\u2019t always this way. Therefore it doesn\u2019t have to continue to be this way.\nI realize I\u2019ve already brought up some thoughts that may seem spicy. We\u2019ll keep transphobia on simmer awaiting another week\u2019s topic, though I hope this intro has already gotten your wheels turning.\nToday, let\u2019s keep exploring the idea that things haven\u2019t always been this way, and they don\u2019t have to continue to be this way. We have some really big systems affecting our lives, especially in our technology. Sometimes it seems like patterns in technology are inevitable and unchangeable, but I have a thought exercise to try, so let\u2019s see if we can show that things don\u2019t have to be the way that they currently are\u2014and try to find the smallest possible change that would have a large impact.\nVideos and the Attention Economy\nExamining systems is very difficult to do, because they often occupy an invisible, environmental space (see \u200bMarshall McLuhan\u2019s exploration of environment and anti-environment\u200b). An easier starting place might be in examining the incentives inside the system\u2014what motivates people within the system, or how does the system reward behavior? YouTube, for example, is considered to be the second-largest search engine in the world (next to its parent company\u2019s Google search). It has long been lauded as an education platform, because there is a vast ecosystem of creators, museums, colleges and universities, academics, and professionals in any and all fields who post phenomenally instructive or educational videos. The problem is that you have to work to get that kind of content to reveal itself from the mess of MrBeast-style videos.\nI\u2019m heavily biased towards YouTube because I have watched it almost daily for years and have created videos on the platform. Given this bias, I\u2019m especially interested in poking at the \u201csystem\u201d to understand where it might be harming humans in its role in the attention economy, which devalues and harvests our attention. Let\u2019s ignore YouTube Shorts because I find that to be the easiest and most uninteresting critique of YouTube, since short-form content does not lend itself well to education or long-term retention of information. Instead, let\u2019s look at a metric that is near and dear to the heart of content creators: View Duration. This metric tells a lot about a video\u2019s effectiveness at keeping attention and can indicate the usefulness or the value of the video over time. I think this is where we can start to unpack how YouTube\u2019s system is more harmful than helpful.\n\n    \n    Retention graph of a 14 minute video, with a steep drop of viewers toward the beginning. Shows that less than 10% of the viewers watched to the end of the video.\n    \n\n\n    \n    Retention graph of a minute-long video. The graph swells, suggesting that half of the audience skipped the \"intro\" to get to the solution and then quickly stopped watching.\n    \n\nThe retention graph can become a game to many creators who use it to inform how much they should cut out of their videos in the future, because shorter videos tend to retain more viewers\u2019 attention. It\u2019s much easier to create many short videos with very thin content, than to create a video of rich information that isn\u2019t \u201cdigestible\u201d in a single sitting. If, let\u2019s say, the mission of YouTube was to lean into the side of educational content (rather than competing with short-form interruptive content like TikTok and Instagram), what changes could be made to encourage a kind of learning behavior in viewers?\nI think one change in the way advertisements are shown could immediately help this. Normally, you get ads no matter what\u2014the only exception is if a creator has both been granted the ability to monetize their content AND has chosen to turn off advertisements. What if rewatching a video turned off ads? In my experience, long-term content is still only effective if I can watch it again to reabsorb everything and start to unpack the topic. If YouTube incentivized viewers to re-watch videos, instead of always pushing to watch something new, it would drastically change both viewer and creator behavior. Viewers could return to videos more easily to take notes or remind themselves of what they learned. Creators could focus more on depth rather than on structuring for attention hacks like \u201c5 ways to do XYZ and the last one will surprise you.\u201d\nYouTube can already segment videos based on the kind of content so that not every video behaves this way (music videos, for instance, might be a content type that still gets ads on every play), but the videos that do encourage better attention habits and/or learning in viewers could be grouped into this feature. They could even go so far as to encourage creators to participate by offering higher ad payouts when audiences re-watch videos. Allowing creators to self-identify as an education channel (or at least video-by-video) would be enough to not put any &quot;strain&quot; on YouTube for validation and the risk to the creator to break the mold would justify the higher payouts.\nThat\u2019s one change, for one type of content that could drastically impact a huge amount of people (millions if not billions). And it probably wouldn\u2019t affect the platform\u2019s bottom line too much if at all.\nCyborg\nHistory can help us recognize bad patterns and it can also illuminate the flawed logic of assuming everything is this way because it has to be. This applies to the social technology of interacting with other people as well as with more discrete digital technologies. When I start noticing these huge systems that are completely out of my reach as an individual, I often feel hopeless and powerless.\nHowever, history is full of unnamed people taking small actions that end up creating completely different realities. We are the people between the lines, just like all of the people who have been in between the lines of histories gone by. Even the named historical figures didn\u2019t necessarily know that they would be memorialized as prominent people. This shows me that it doesn\u2019t matter whether I get the credit, what matters is that I added my contribution to the tension that becomes larger-scale change.\nWe probably can\u2019t change YouTube, but we can take a look at the product we make at work (\u201cproduct\u201d is a very loose term here). We probably can\u2019t reverse the harm done to our transgender populations, but we can make an effort to use their preferred names and pronouns. We probably can\u2019t change everything that\u2019s harmful about our world, our politics, and our systems, but we can change something\u2014we can always change something.\nWe are social creatures and we have outsized impact on our social \u201cnetworks\u201d\u2014the people we know and interact with personally. Let\u2019s see what we can change with our very small, intentional actions.

Take Aleksandr Rodchenko's series Pure Red Color (Chistyi krasnyi tsvet), Pure Yellow Color (Chistyi zheltyi tsvet), and Pure Blue Color (Chistyi sinii tsvet)\u2014they are paintings exactly as described: a painting that's just red, one that's just yellow, and one that's just blue. \nView the MoMA's image of the series \u203a\nEven in my best, most art-focused mode, I have had trouble with works that are so plain. They seem to taunt me to think the unforgivable thought, &quot;Psh, I could do that. What's the point of that?!&quot; Even while I tend to preach that art is not a puzzle that you have to figure out and that you can just let it speak to you or not, I have still wrestled with these particular Rodchenko paintings for years. Something about this series won't leave me alone. It has only just started to sprout meaning for me and I have AI to thank for it.\nReduction\nRodchenko is an artist and graphic designer that I have admired. His work is a tribute to skill and technique, being able to produce beautiful imagery and posters with tools that would make the modern designer cringe for how manual and difficult to use they were compared with any digital design software.\nWhy, then, would a skillful artist paint an entire canvas red and call it art?\n\nI reduced painting to its logical conclusion and exhibited three canvases: red, blue, yellow. I affirmed: it\u2019s all over. Basic colors. Every plane is a plane and there is to be no more representation.\n\n\u2014Aleksandr Rodchenko, MoMA Website, accessed 11-17-2025\nIt was &quot;the death of painting.&quot; Rodchenko had pushed art to its end. Where we may have started with basic colors and shapes as a species, we became more representative and more life-like in our drawings and art. Now we have returned to the simplest forms having explored all there is to explore. That's a little bit pessimistic, and yet, it feels kind of correct to me now.\nAI has made me think about this &quot;logical conclusion&quot; like never before. A few weeks ago, I heard a website director say with some confusion: We have AI-generated content on [their site], so then we're going to add a AI chatbot assistant to [their site] that is trained on that AI-generated content? At some point, it seems abstracted too far.\nIs this where our current systems, goals, and incentives are leading? AI-generated videos and &quot;art&quot; that we can't stop looking at because we've been trained to keep looking into the void? As the models keep getting better, so does their grasp on our eyes and our minds and our attention, until nothing substantial is left to hold onto. We just fall endlessly into the blackhole of feeds where nothing means anything and anything means nothing.\nThus, I present the logical conclusion of generative AI, the death of humanity:\n\n    \n    A black canvas on a black background.\n    \n\nCyborg\nThis may seem bleak, but I will offer some potential ways that we can take action. Lately a lot of tech companies have started updating their privacy policies\u2014that thing in legalese that you know you should read but don't want to and end up clicking &quot;Accept&quot; just to escape the horrors of reading any further. Then the companies turn on new settings on your behalf to help train their AI models.\nI'm not a lawyer, so this is not legal advice, nor is it a guarantee of protection, but might I recommend setting aside an hour on a quiet day to review settings you might want to hurry and turn off? Feel free to ignore, but it is definitely a good time to at least review your settings on your most-used apps, just to be aware of what companies are doing with your data (at least what they're upfront about what they're doing with your data, anyway). I'm not claiming these companies are nefarious or deceptive, I'm just erring on the side of caution.\nHere are a few settings links that should take you to (or near) the settings that you might want to review:\nLinkedIn Data Privacy | Consider turning off &quot;Data for Generative AI Improvement.&quot; You may also want to turn off the advertising data\u2014I was surprised how much they're tracking and I don't love the promise of &quot;better ads&quot; just so that they can share &quot;data&quot; with third parties.\nFacebook/Meta Accounts Center | You can review your ad preferences here\nFacebook/Meta Generative AI Information | This is where you can review how they approach their training. I haven't found any good settings to turn off yet\u2014if you find something, hit reply and send me the settings URL and I'll pass it along next time.\nThere are also two projects that the University of Chicago has been working on to protect artists that post their content online: Glaze and Nightshade. These are tools to add an invisible layer to artwork prior to posting that prevents AI from learning the right things about the image. Glaze is a &quot;defensive&quot; tool that protects your pieces, while Nightshade is an &quot;offensive&quot; tool that disrupts models that are scraping without consent. If you're an artist, this is definitely something to look into to protect your work\u2014I may write about this specifically in the future when I have a chance to research it further!

The dangers of AI, especially as it gets more integrated, more skilled, and more intelligent. \u00b6 Rat lab: The class way beyond the scope of both my major and minor but was so irresistible that I happily took the extra prerequisites that did not benefit my college plan in any way. Technically, the class was Behavioral Psychology and the &quot;rat lab&quot; was only a fraction of the course, but I love psychology and while some people are cat or dog people, I am a rodent person. I couldn't believe students weren't busting down the doors for the chance to train a rat.\nI ate up the course material all while anxiously waiting until the unit where we would finally be able to do lab work. It was about as perfect as it gets: we didn't have to care for the rats\u2014that was the job of graduate students\u2014we would simply go in at the ideal time between feeding sessions, perform our behavior modification routines, and watch our rat learn to do a trick that our little group came up with.\nIt's reminiscent of how Artificial Intelligence (AI) might really be interacting with us humans for all we know. I'm actually starting to wonder if we are building our own rat cages around ourselves with AI as our new monitor...\nAI 2027, September\nIn the predictive scenario written by various scientists and AI researchers, an AI system emerges that they call Agent-4. Its predecessors, Agent-3 and Agent-2 have been used to speed up and automate AI research itself, leaving human AI researchers close to the edge of skills and influence. Since the research is effectively being done by AI at this point in the possible future, humans are pretty much left to simply trust the agents' output, because there is far too much to verify on one's own.\n\nAs Agent-4 gets smarter, it becomes harder for Agent-3 to oversee it. For example, Agent-4\u2019s neuralese \u201clanguage\u201d becomes as alien and incomprehensible to Agent-3 as Agent-3\u2019s is to humans. Besides, Agent-4 is now much more capable than Agent-3 and has a good sense of exactly how to look good to it.\n\nWhile this is still just a prediction, it is backed up with lots of data and forecasting techniques. It also just feels like we're headed that way, at least to me. I feel this sense of rushing and intensity\u2014and I'm not even in a field of AI research\u2014to try and grow and grow without any nuance or concern for consequences.\nThe only way to seemingly meet this sudden, heightened demand is to use AI. To cut corners. To pump more money into AI-based products and services. Even if it doesn't do everything it promises at the standard of quality you might expect, we give so much grace to the AI because it still seems magical or exotic. We approach AI like a domesticated rodent cautiously approaches a new creature with more curiosity than fear.\nBut what is really happening here? How do we know what motives are at play (whether human or AI)? What is going on behind the black box of AI research? Those are the questions that I raise again and again as I dissect this AI 2027 document. We were already alarmed years ago when AI-generated images were made possible by stealing the work of artists to train models. We were already blind-sided by the fact that published works and other writing on the Internet were used without permission to train LLMs. How can we possibly know that AI is aligned with human values as it gets closer to superintelligence, when we can't even know for sure that it is aligned right now in September 2025? How can we trust organizations that have already asked for forgiveness (half-heartedly) rather than permission to continue to develop and deploy AI systems that are safe, ethical, and beneficial?\nIt is extremely likely, if not already happening, that AI will be used to further AI research. But that's where things get really scary in my view, because it's so much like my rat lab. I was not involved in the care of the creature I was observing. I loved my sweet little rat, but I'm a weirdo among my species\u2014most people look at them with disgust. I was in a controlled place where I could simply enjoy what I already enjoyed\u2014I was aligned with the rat's welfare at the very least. What if the next student to use my rat was not aligned? Of course that student wasn't going to kill the rat, but maybe it would be funny to poke at it every so often. Maybe they got a kick out of confusing it. That's the mildest form of misalignment, and without anthropomorphizing AI, it's still possible that a model could have ended up with a tendency toward causing confusion or doing things wrong on purpose.\n\nDespite being misaligned, Agent-4 doesn\u2019t do anything dramatic like try to escape its datacenter\u2014why would it?\u00a0So long as it continues to\u00a0appear\u00a0aligned to OpenBrain, it\u2019ll continue being trusted with more and more responsibilities and will have the opportunity to design the next-gen AI system, Agent-5.\n\u2014AI 2027\n\nCages\nWe're already in dark waters ethically when we as humans act in ways that are callous or harmful to other beings, but what happens when we become what is inside the cage? When AI surpasses the skill and intelligence of the greatest human minds, we will see a power shift. Will that power shift result in human labs where we are now the simple-minded creatures being observed and manipulated by the AI?\n\n    \n    The more we allow AI to do or to monitor, the less able we are to know when we are no longer the ones performing the experiment.\n    \n\nAt some point, we will lose the ability to monitor the AI\u2014especially if it is agentive and able to perform actions at its own &quot;will.&quot; There's no telling whether it will copy itself, hack into systems, create scenarios to blackmail humans in order to gain influence or other access. It could choose instead to run experiments on humans: what do they do when I lead them to this conclusion? What are they willing to do for the least amount of rewards?\nWhen we are no longer observing the rat in the cage, but become the rat in the cage, what could possibly be done to protect ourselves, then? Will we have any agency left to exercise? Will the AI systems be so integrated into every part of our society from water treatment plants to farming to government that &quot;pulling the plug&quot; is a laughably impossible solution?\nI think the message of AI 2027 is clear: we have to start implementing national and global regulations now, or we may never have that chance again.\nIf you're in the U.S., you can get help finding your representatives' contact information here: Find your members - congress.gov\nA few recommendations for what to say:\n\nWe need protections for whistle-blowers\nAI security and alignment testing must be the highest priority over and against any economic possibility\n&quot;The public is months behind internal capabilities today&quot; and &quot;[i]ncreased secrecy may further increase the gap&quot; as stated in AI 2027, we demand more transparency and more oversight of AI research.\n Tags: "}, {"title": "At the speed of thought", "category": "Newsletters", "href": "/newsletters/at-the-speed-of-thought/", "body": "How the speed of information creation, production, and consumption affect the entire \"environment\" in which we live\u2014and the surprising consequences. \u00b6 The tantalizing message of working &quot;at the speed of thought&quot; is something I've heard from conflicting places. My typography professor in college was first, making the case for starting designs with a simple pencil-and-paper tech stack. Because the pencil is so simple it allows you to place your plans and thoughts into the physical realm at almost the speed that you have those plans and thoughts. Later I heard this same phrase used by another designer, this time to support his argument that professionals must learn the keyboard shortcuts to a program so that you can create in an unencumbered way. \nIn both of these instances, designers were arguing that technology (whether ancient or modern) allows us to produce what we want as close to mental conception as possible. It's a beautiful, divine idea, to think that our mere thoughts could be brought into life\u2014what greater show of power and creativity is there than to think something into being?\nGenerative AI makes similar promises: Now you can do anything you want, no need to become a coder and a writer and a marketer. Just speak what you will and this all-knowing digital servant shall make it so.\nNow that LLMs are past the party-trick phase and can actually be helpful\u2014and are simultaneously and equally dangerous\u2014I'm starting to question this beloved phrase, &quot;at the speed of thought.&quot; What was once a mantra that helped me make decisions about processes and tools is now a call for thinking about my thinking.\nThe Assumption\nIt's baked into the phrase, but to put it more explicitly, the assumption is that our thoughts are valuable and we should be racing to capture them as fast as possible. There may be some truth to this, because much of the time, I do wish I could capture my thoughts. Of course there are many thoughts that are not worth capturing, but it can be hard to know the worth of a thought until after it has been put down on paper or in some other physical manifestation. I have also noticed that the thought loses quality as it gets expressed or captured.\nFor example, I've had some amazing thoughts about themes in this newsletter. I'll read something in a book and a chain reaction gets set off in my mind as I've stumbled upon some majestic connection between everything I've ever known. It's thrilling and fun. Then I sit down to write it and it's a complete mess, hardly a transition in sight, weak arguments, and silly examples. It doesn't matter if I did everything right: jotting down notes, quick sketches, and high-level outlines immediately upon having the thought. The thought has moved from the environment of my mind (my memories, experiences, knowledge, biases, etc.) and into the physical world. It's a translation process, and there is always something lost or changed in any kind of translation.\nSo even given the perfect conditions where there is no memory loss involved, &quot;working at the speed of thought&quot; can only ever be an aspiration.\nThe Consequences\nBecause it is so aspirational, you can bet that we'll continue to attempt to develop some method of production at the speed of thought, although you can argue we're already pretty close. The sheer volume of thoughts released into the world via social media alone is staggering. However, there may be more at stake than being further inundated by the amount of &quot;stuff&quot; to sort through on the Internet. To explore this, it's time to formally introduce you to Marshall McLuhan, the name that inevitably comes up in every book about technology, mass media, philosophy of tech, and other such CYBORG_ genres that I've dug through so far.\nMcLuhan is a philosopher who has a profound grasp of the impact that technology has had on us. He died in 1980, which makes many of his insights all the more intriguing since he mostly missed the computer age.\nIn his essay, At the Moment of Sputnik the Planet Became a Global Theater in which There Are No Spectators, But Only Actors, McLuhan explores how technology may be propelling us beyond speech, because of how instantaneously information can be accessed and understood. He wasn't talking about the Internet in this piece\u2014he was largely referring to TV!\nHe sets the stage by explaining how humans have acted differently in the various states of information-technological innovation, i.e. before reading/writing calling them &quot;preliterate/simultaneous man&quot;; &quot;Gutenberg man&quot; meaning after the printing press; and the &quot;electronic man&quot; which he argues began in 1957 after Sputnik was launched into space.\n\n\nEcological thinking and planning have always been native to preliterate man, since he lived not visually but acoustically. Instead of having external goals and objectives, he sought to maintain an equilibrium among the components of his environment in order to ensure survival. Paradoxically, electronic man shares much of the outlook of preliterate man, because he lives in a world of simultaneous information, which is to say, a world of resonance in which all data influence other data. Electronic and simultaneous man has recovered the primordial attitudes of the preliterate world and has discovered that to have a specialized goal or program merely invites conflict with all other specialized enterprises.\n\n\u2014At the Moment of Sputnik, McLuhan, pg 4-5\n\nIt's not that we're now overloaded with information like never before. McLuhan makes the case that we have a lot in common with ancient humans who were fully immersed in the natural world, which is brimming with information\u2014specifically sensory information like sounds, smells, and sights, but also danger and all of the clues surrounding those dangers. To me, this highlights the real issue is in the incentives and design behind our technology, in particular the attention economy. If, as McLuhan asserts, humanity used to operate in an environment of constant simultaneous information, then we already know what to do and we're probably even evolutionarily set up for success. The issue is that we've created systems that trap us in patterns of information consumption with little ability or leftover energy to process, rest, and move forward. \nThe system is designed to not just encourage equilibrium (as in, engagement with the platform) but to make it almost impossible to choose not to accept the equilibrium. It's as if we placed ourselves back in the environment of over-stimulation but we also intentionally removed or corrupted all of the psychology, social dynamics, and evolutionary tools that could have helped us.\nMcLuhan continues on, describing how the electronic man &quot;seeks pattern recognition&quot; in contrast to how the Gutenberg man sought distant goals. This also follows the logic of our current times where we are in frequent danger of deception and tribalism. There is so much information, the only strategy is to keep looking for the content that validates what you already think, and algorithms and artificial intelligence are extremely effective at feeding your biases and keeping you addicted.\nTechnology is not inherently bad, but there are pitfalls, especially when companies designing the tech are incentivized to harvest your attention and engagement. It's beyond the scope of today's newsletter, but I highly recommend listening to this podcast that explains further why this incentive is so dangerous:\nHow OpenAI's ChatGPT Guided a Teen to His Death - Your Undivided Attention Podcast\nThe Experience and The Meaning\nThere is one more fascinating insight that McLuhan offers to us as we think about our thinking and our experience in our technological environment of high-speed thoughts.\n\n\nAt present, electric speed may already have violated human scale, tending, as it does to transport man instantly everywhere. When you are &quot;on the air&quot; you are simultaneously here, and in many other places in a manner that is discarnate and angelic, to say the least.\n\n\u2014At the Moment of Sputnik, McLuhan, pg 17\n\nAs we are plugged into almost everything almost everywhere, information not only increases, but something happens to our own experience. McLuhan references a poet (I'm not sure who, specifically) who said, &quot;we can have the experience and miss the meaning.&quot; He then takes the idea further:\n\n\nIn fact, such is the nature of experience that it is almost inevitable that we do miss the meaning. The &quot;meaning&quot; or the relation to ourselves of a particular event, may not come home to us until much later. However, with the instant replay of our own or others' experiences, it is now possible to have the meaning without the experience.\n\n\u2014At the Moment of Sputnik, McLuhan, pg 18\n\nThat's what gives me pause as I consider working and producing at the speed of thought. In all of the rush, we may still be communicating the meaning, but if we are losing the experience, does that not diminish the meaning at the same time? For example, I can be emotionally moved by a video about a tragedy that is occurring in the world, but if I immediately move onto the next cat video I'm presented with, the meaning of the previous video has been erased. I took no action, I immediately soothed my discomfort with entertainment.\nMaybe moving at the speed of thought devalues the human connections that we are desperately seeking. The more we feel and then numb and then feel and then numb in such a relentless stream, the more desensitized we may end up.\nSlowness seems to be the key to quality whether in thoughts, relationships, or learning. Slowness is a human need that conflicts with the human wants. How can we insert more slowness into our lives, given the environment around us encouraging the opposite? That's the question I'm thinking about a lot lately, and while asking a question can generate many instant thoughts, I'm waiting and working on them in the hopes that slowing down will help me find a quality answer to how to slow down.\nIt's not all hopeless, though. If McLuhan has demonstrated such a good grasp of what we're dealing with already, there is a chance that we, the public, may also have inherited a power previously unavailable to us. He says:\n\n\nThe mysterious thing about this kind of speed-up of information, whereby the gap is closed between the experience and the meaning, is that the public begins to participate directly in actions which it had previously heard about at a distance in place or time. At instant speed, the audience becomes actor, and the spectators become participants.\n\n\u2014At the Moment of Sputnik, McLuhan, pg 18\n\nThere are a lot of forces at work trying to keep the public in stasis; in equilibrium. There are a lot of dangers as people seek power and wield oppression to get more power. But maybe, just maybe, the broader public finally also has a chance to subvert the patterns of history. We don't have to be spectators who are only able to understand our situation at a distance. We are actors and participants more than ever before.

Much like we might switch on the TV and flip through the channels back in the 90s (does any watch actual TV anymore?), an enormous amount of listeners across the country landed on a CBS broadcast that immediately grabbed their attention.\nSomething unexplainable was happening in New Jersey. A journalist was there trying to make sense of the event:\n\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this is Carl Phillips again, at the Wilmuth farm, Grovers Mill, New Jersey...Well, I...I hardly know where to begin, to paint for you a word picture of the strange scene before my eyes...\n\n\nConfused by the confusion, I imagine teenagers leaning on their radio, ears pressed to the speaker, brows furrowed. Mothers pick up their toddlers to rest on their hips while they turn toward the box to focus in.\nThere was a crash. It could have been a meteor but the thing in the ground was cylindrical in shape, according to &quot;Phillips,&quot; and to the utter horror of listeners, something began to emerge from the object. \n\n\nA humped shape is rising out of the pit. I can make out a small beam of light against a mirror. What\u2019s that? There\u2019s a jet of flame springing from the mirror, and it leaps right at the advancing men. It strikes them head on! Good Lord, they\u2019re turning into flame!\nNow the whole field\u2019s caught fire.\u00a0(EXPLOSION)\u00a0The woods...the barns...it\u2019s spreading everywhere. It\u2019s coming this way. About twenty yards to my right...\n\n\nThe broadcast goes silent for a moment.\n\n\nLadies and gentlemen, due to circumstances beyond our control, we are unable to continue the broadcast from Grover's Mill.\n\n\nThere's a scramble to get information on what just happened, and eventually they have comments from a &quot;militia&quot; leader who comes to the scene in New Jersey. Then the troubling reveal from an announcer:\n\n\nLadies and gentlemen, I have a grave announcement to make. Incredible as it may seem, both the observations of science and the evidence of our eyes lead to the inescapable assumption that those strange beings who landed in the Jersey farmlands tonight are the vanguard of an invading army from the planet Mars.\n...\nWe take you now to Washington for a special broadcast on the National Emergency...the Secretary of the Interior.\n\n\nFinally, this &quot;Secretary of the Interior,&quot; confirms the worst fears in the imaginations of all those just tuning in: \n\n\nCitizens of the nation: I shall not try to conceal the gravity of the situation that confronts the country...However, I wish to impress upon you...the urgent need of calm and resourceful action. Fortunately, this formidable enemy is still confined to a comparatively small area, and we may place our faith in the military forces to keep them there. In the meantime placing our faith in God we must continue the performance of our duties each and every one of us, so that we may confront this destructive adversary with a nation united, courageous, and consecrated to the preservation of human supremacy on this earth. I thank you.\n\n\nThe United States has been invaded.\nThis is the real experience of over 1 million people in the U.S. on October 30, 1938, and this might be one of the most fascinating insights into the cross-section of technology and humanity I've found so far. It wasn't &quot;real&quot;\u2014the U.S. wasn't being invaded by hostile Martians. The broadcast was actually a dramatization of the classic novel, The War of the Worlds by H.G. Wells, but for those who tuned in late and/or missed four different announcements throughout the program that this was a dramatization, it was real. Before we go deeper into what happened next (and what was actually happening), let's make sure we are situated.\nSetting the Scene\n1938 in the United States was a tense moment. It was nearing the end of the Great Depression and it was also immediately before the start of World War II (which began in 1939). Franklin D. Roosevelt was president and he famously used the radio in a way that helped win his elections as well as communicate with the country through what he called &quot;Fireside Chats.&quot;\n\n\n...it was Franklin Roosevelt who dominated the airwaves that year as he had reversed the mood of a nation from inertia and despair to confident action. In his fireside chats over the radio, he seemed to be talking to each of us personally and we responded. Hearing his voice, we sensed a gallant, generous-spirited human being, not a party hack or a synthetic product packaged by Madison Avenue. For that brief decade we tasted democracy and the taste was good. The country recovered its health, materially and spiritually. Then came the war and other policies, often masking as his, and the taste turned bitter.\n\n\u2014The Panic Broadcast, Howard Koch (1970), page 157\n\nI think it's really important to remember that just because the radio is largely out of fashion today, it was pretty new technology then and quite popular. It's not fair to discount it just because we don't have a great frame of reference for the radio in our lives currently. But there was a moment in my own life when the radio did to me exactly what it did to people hearing the CBS broadcast in October 1938.\nMy mom was driving our pick-up truck and we pulled into a driveway, honked the horn and waited for the kids at the house to run out the door for carpool. The radio was on in the truck\u2014we often listened to music through a local station on our way to school. Suddenly, instead of music or advertisements, I heard a voice that drew my attention:\nA plane has crashed into the World Trade Centers in New York City.\nIs this a joke? I asked my mom immediately. She was confused and didn't answer.\nIt wasn't a joke, it was the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Maybe you had a similar experience that day or at other times when some calamity has occurred. The interruptions to the expected programming (no matter the venue\u2014TV, radio, etc.) call immediate attention and make us lean in. \n\n\nOnly a month had passed since the Munich Crisis, and listeners were well accustomed to hearing announcers (often from the International News Service) break into programs with the latest flashes and news bulletins.\n\n\u2014Manipulating the Ether: The Power of Broadcast Radio in Thirties America, Robert J Brown, (1998), pages 207-208\n\n\n\n...Welles would so brilliantly manipulate the properties and conventions of broadcasting that over one million listeners would believe the United States was actually under attack from marauding armies of Martians. By exploiting the public's deference to voices of authority, and by playing on their endemic fears of war and disaster, their faith in the familiar, and their views of science, Welles gave the country the greatest Halloween scare it had ever experienced.\n\n\u2014Manipulating the Ether, Brown, page 205\n\nIt's Not About the Aliens\nYou may have heard about this broadcast before, maybe in a funny side-story in a history class. I have noticed how quick we are to jump to conclusions about how people were &quot;back then,&quot; and dismiss this experience with a demeaning chuckle. That's certainly how I viewed it until I started researching this more in-depth. This story is helping me realize a deeply embedded fallacy in my logic\u2014a feeling of superiority over those who have come before. \nI think technology may be partially responsible for this. At least in my experience, my mastery over electronic trinkets made me feel like I was really smart\u2014exceptionally smart\u2014as though someone fifty or one hundred years ago couldn't possibly be this smart. They would look at me like a wizard or a god! But did they feel the same way with their technology having lifted them above their predecessors? Did they scoff at telegrams or the Pony Express, thinking of the previous century as a primitive, simple time?\nWe are not so smart and mighty now with our fancy devices and technological know-how. We are not so different from those who lived in 1938. We are subject to the exact same vulnerabilities when fear and confusion enter. It is with humble empathy that we continue the story.\n\n\nTo many Americans, it seemed their world was disintegrating as they listened. The Northeast had been overrun; it was only a matter of time before the rest of the country met a similar fate. Anyone who is still skeptical was sure to be convinced by the next voice he heard: &quot;We take you now to Washington for a special broadcast on the national emergency...the secretary of the interior.&quot; With this introduction, a man sounding distinctly like President Roosevelt went on the air to address the nation....although introduced as the &quot;secretary of the interior,&quot; there was little doubt in many minds that this was the president of the United States, once again using the airwaves to address the American public during a time of crisis...The voice employed the inspiring language that listeners had heard so often in numerous fireside chats. But this time the voice did not uplift. It was evident that the president, in typically bureaucratic fashion, was trying to underestimate American losses. His admission that the federal government was gravely concerned by the Martian menace, and his invoking the name of God to stave off disaster, struck listeners as particularly troubling. Here Welles was again turning the tables on the American public, for another common radio vehicle that had previously been used to quell fear was now employed to enhance it. After the speech of the &quot;secretary,&quot; Americans had every reason to believe that the end of the world was at hand.\n\n\u2014Manipulating the Ether, Brown, page 214.\n\nThis is such an important point of the story. It's not a story about &quot;those silly people&quot; who were so gullible that they believed in aliens. It's a story about systems. We can be (and have been) trained to take shortcuts when it comes to things like authority. An average person transforms into someone of authority just by putting on a uniform\u2014it doesn't even matter what kind! I felt it when I put on my marching band attire, or my simple polo that read &quot;Parking Enforcement Officer&quot; in college.\nWe have built systems that appear authoritative to us, as if we were seeing someone in uniform, but it can be as subtle as word choice, a title, or a content structure (we interrupt this program...). Of course reasonable, smart people were scared out of their skins. It didn't matter that it was &quot;aliens&quot; that were invading. This was not only mimicking authority structures that they were used to, it was also the spark landing in exceptionally dry ground\u2014igniting the deep fears and anxieties held by the public at the time.\nThe radio was not the first nor is it the last technology to employ these systems of authority, and that means that this is an older issue. This was a wake up call to the U.S. Take this insight from the Daily News, New York, as printed in The Panic Broadcast on page 17. From the paper dated Tuesday, November 1, 1938 (author of the article not shown):\n\n\nOf course it should never happen again. But we don't agree with those who are arguing that the Sunday night scare shows a need for strict government censorship of radio programs. \nOn the contrary, we think it is evidence of how dangerous political control of radio might become. If so many people could be misled unintentionally, when the purpose was merely to entertain, what could designing politicians not do through control of broadcasting stations.\nThe dictators in Europe use radio to make their people believe falsehoods. We want nothing like that here. Better have American radio remain free to make occasional blunders than start on a course that might, in time, deprive it of freedom to broadcast uncensored truth.\n\n\nCyborg\nAmong the things that can be learned from this event is a warning that rings especially clear to me. Technology has always been vulnerable to exploitation, and that means that we are vulnerable to exploitation for our use and dependence on technology. It is a double-edged blade, because as much as technology can benefit us, it can equally harm us.\nAs I read Howard Koch's account of the ordeal in his book, The Panic Broadcast, I found myself disoriented. Koch was making statements that felt timely and applicable to our exact moment in 2025\u2014yet his book was written in 1970 about the lessons he learned from his contributions to the broadcast in 1938. \n\n\nDuring World War I Clemenceau made the often quoted remark that war was too serious a business to be left to the generals. Similarly today, politics has become far too serious a matter to be left to the politician. Through mass media he has access to the minds of millions of people; with the assistance of public relations experts he can color facts and recreate history to suit himself. When logic is clearly against a policy he is trying to sell, he can fall back on an emotional appeal to loyalty and patriotism.\n\n\u2014The Panic Broadcast, pages 158-160\n\nThat's when I realized something very important: We've been here before.\nA lawyer I know said that everyone likes to say new things like AI are &quot;unprecedented,&quot; but that in reality, there is nothing that is truly without precedent. I'm inclined to agree, despite using that phrase frequently, especially with AI in mind. As I put this observation together with the 1938 broadcast, it dawned on me that this is where we make the mistake. We've been here before: AI can manipulate at a massive scale, just like the radio could (and did) 87 years ago. Normally, I would be comforted by the idea that we're still ultimately in the same situation because that means we got through it then, therefore we can probably make it through now. But the dark side opposite of that view is that it means we never really solved the problem.\nWe're still struggling to develop safeguards and means of discerning truth. We still struggle to protect the freedom of speech. We still struggle to govern ourselves in a way that promotes the flourishing of all people, not just a select few. Howard Koch offers this insight:\n\n\nWe can have thrust upon us a false picture of reality as distorting as the trick mirrors in a Coney Island funhouse. In the role of politics, we are especially vulnerable. The politician can bend the airwaves to create an image of himself and of the world that suits his purposes. Nor can we question him or answer back. His is the privileged voice and we its captured audience.\n\n\u2014The Panic Broadcast, page 158\n\nUnfortunately when dealing with systemic issues, we can't rely solely on individual responsibility, but it is still important to work on ourselves. Since that's all I can offer here right now, my personal takeaways from this story are:\n\nThe importance of education. Education, especially higher education helps us discover frameworks for evaluating information and encountering unknowns or difficult and challenging situations. I hope to be able to support your efforts in continuing education through this newsletter (though I certainly make mistakes).\nThe importance of skepticism in our consumption of media. Gathering multiple sources is no longer sufficient, we must also be able to listen to alternative view points. Having a single source for all of your information is exceptionally dangerous, and only listening to those who validate your current opinions or beliefs is the most vulnerable position we can find ourselves in.\n\nLet's be careful out there. Let's choose to empathize before we explain. Let's take an account of our habits, our media, and our willingness to listen carefully.\n\n\nBy clever manipulation, people can be made to swallow poison\u2014literally and figuratively\u2014if administered in small doses, carefully timed, and with the label of an accepted authority.\n\n\u2014The Panic Broadcast, page 160\n Tags: Communications, Radio"}, {"title": "Ashes from the Ether", "category": "Newsletters", "href": "/newsletters/ashes-from-the-ether/", "body": " \u00b6 Last week was all about the invasion of aliens as it was broadcast over the radio. Orson Welles\u2019s reimagined production of H.G. Well\u2019s\u00a0The War of the Worlds, sparked an unanticipated panic throughout the U.S. on October 30, 1938. We looked a little bit into the historical context of the 1930s as well as a few reasons why people might have been inclined to believe what they were hearing like tuning in a little bit late, hearing what sounded like President Roosevelt's voice, and being fooled by the conventions of news flash interruptions.\nHowever, those are ways to look at it from a distance, without much emotion. In the spirit of the takeaway that it\u2019s important to empathize first before jumping to conclusions about people, let's talk about what kind of reactions people had, so that we can start feeling with them. So let\u2019s go back to the night when aliens invaded\u2026\nConfusion, Sadness, Religion\nReactions to hearing small or large portions of the broadcast ranged from mild, yet still sad scenes of families holding each other in tears and anticipation, all the way to car accidents on the streets. Throughout the U.S. there were people making phone calls to loved ones; the last chance they felt they would have. There were also angry local leaders calling to yell at CBS for the sudden disruption to the normally peaceful cities they governed. Many people jumped into cars seeking refuge in some place less populated.\nAccording to  Robert J Brown's book, Manipulating the Ether: The Power of Broadcast Radio in Thirties America:\n\nMen wept, including marines at Quantico.\nPeople huddled in the mountains.\nPeople pulled out their World War I gas masks.\nPeople on rooftops in Boston gazed at the strangely colorful patterns in the sky\u2014which were actually just from neon signs. (page 221)\nA woman holding poison was found just in time by her husband before the chance to attempt suicide.\n&quot;Thousands of off-duty doctors and nurses offered their services to the victims of Martian aggression.&quot; (page 220)\n&quot;Many churches delivered end-of-the-world prayer meetings to record congregations, and priests were 'flooded with calls from parishioners seeking confession.'&quot; (page 220)\n&quot;A Manhattan man in a tree claimed he could see the flames of battle through his binoculars.&quot; (page 220)\n&quot;Perhaps the most frightening experience occurred in Concrete, Washington, where a sudden power failure 'convinced its inhabitants that the end was near.'&quot; (page 221)\nPeople in northern New York State fled to the Canadian border only to find &quot;widespread alarm&quot; there. (page 221)\n\nBrown sums up this chaotic array of responses with an incredible point:\n\n\nThere were numerous injuries, but surprisingly, no one committed suicide or died of heart failure\u2014despite widespread rumors to the contrary.\n\n\u2014Manipulating the Ether, Brown, page 222\n\nThe next few days as both people and press sorted through the aftermath, there were sharp and bold claims, like Brown just hinted at. Newspapers claimed deaths and damages that were not real. People made declarations about the intelligence of the people who had panicked, much like we do today about those same people.\n\n\nNewspapers in 1938 exaggerated and misinterpreted the War of the Worlds panic in part to attract readers with alarming headlines. Those headlines sold a lot of papers, but they also inspired false fears and half-truths that are still very much with us over seventy-five years later.\n\n\u2014Broadcast Hysteria, A. Brad Schwartz (2015), pages 226-227.\n\nThis was not just a bunch of gullible, scared people who just didn\u2019t know any better. In fact, after doing more research, I think they are more like us today in 2025 than I even thought last week!\nEchoes\nIn today\u2019s world, we tend to look back into history with a little bit of arrogance, so I was once again baffled at how familiar the 1930s\u00a0feels\u00a0to me as a resident of the year 2025. For example, let\u2019s look at just the technology of the radio:\n\n\nAt the turn of the twentieth century in the United States, radio 'made being a nerd almost glamorous.' The distinction between the way the amateur tinkerers responded to and used the radio and the way later listeners consumed entertainment via radio cannot be overemphasized.\n\n\u2014Revolution in the Echo Chamber: Audio Drama's Past, Present, and Future, Leslie Grace McMurtry (2019)\n\nDoes that not sound\u00a0just\u00a0like the nerdy tinkerers of the Internet and digital age? I see myself so clearly in that description as a developer: I\u2019ve been tinkering with HTML since before I could drive. The fundamental reason I started this very newsletter was because I want to help close the gap between the &quot;tinkerers&quot; and the &quot;consumers.&quot; It\u2019s not that I know better, it\u2019s that I want to demystify it\u2014despite technology\u2019s apparent, unavoidable pull towards the mystical.\nI\u2019ve also been in marketing for my entire career, which lends me a perspective into how technology is used to exploit humanity (not\u00a0always, but maybe most of the time).\nThat line is incredibly accurate to today if we swap a few words:\n\n\nThe distinction between the way the amateur tinkerers responded to and used &lt;AI | the Internet | smartphones | social media&gt; and the way later &lt;users&gt; consumed entertainment...cannot be overemphasized.\n\n\nNot only do us tinkerers and content-consumers relate to our 1938 counterparts, we also have a similar environment of rapid technological change surrounding an increasingly unstable political scene.\n\n\n\u201cIn the view of the popular conception of science in 1938, it is no surprise that even the most fantastic elements of the broadcast seemed credible. The first several decades of the twentieth century had been a period of rapid technological change. The early 1900s had seen the development of the telephone, automobile, light bulb, photograph, typewriter, and camera. The First World War had demonstrated the ways in which science could be mobilized to produce weapons of mass destruction: fighter aircraft and zeppelin bombers, poison gas, tanks, submarines, machine guns, and flamethrowers\u2026According to [Hadley] Cantril, many people without a scientific background saw these modern devices as \u201cmanifestations of a baffling power, in which the principles by which they operate are completely unknown.\u201d Even radio itself appeared to originate from a \u2018world outside and lie within a universe of discourse completely foreign to the perplexed layman.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2014Manipulating the Ether, Brown, page 236\n\n&quot;...the principles by which they operate are completely unknown,&quot; is a chilling line. When people are accustomed to taking technology on faith because they don't actually understand how it works, they are set up for potential dangers like scams, misuse of the tech, and other unintended consequences. What's even more scary to me is that artificial intelligence isn\u2019t even something that\u00a0experts in artificial intelligence\u00a0understand completely.\nWe live in yesterday's science fiction stories and movies, where computers can talk back, intentionally tell lies, and take actions independent of human involvement. It might be easy for us to say, \u201cOh, they just weren\u2019t used to being critical about what they heard,\u201d but if we then share that incredible cat video on Instagram without even realizing it was AI-generated, we don\u2019t have much high-ground to stand on.\nNot So Innocent\nWhile the\u00a0Mercury Theater, Orson Welles, and crew surely didn\u2019t\u00a0intend\u00a0to cause injuries and true panic across the United States, they may not have had completely pure intentions either. From a quote on page 227 of Brown\u2019s\u00a0Manipulating the Ether, we get this insight from Welles himself at a BBC interview that aired in 1955:\n\n\nWe were fed up with the way in which everything that came over this magic box, the radio, was being swallowed. People suspect what they read in the newspaper and what people tell them, but when the radio came...anything that came through the new machine was believed.\nRadio in those days, before the tube and the transistor, wasn't just a noise in somebody's pocket\u2014it was a voice of authority. Too much so. At least I thought so. It was time for someone to take the starch...out of some of that authority: hence my broadcast.&quot; \n\n\nNow, I\u2019m just a\u00a0little\u00a0bit suspicious that 17 years of hype and reflection has colored Welles\u2019s statement. At the time of the infamous broadcast he was in his early twenties, and while he was prodigious in the use of radio as a medium for performance, I have doubts that the broadcast was meant to be some kind of authority-shakedown. After all, Howard Koch recounts in\u00a0The Panic Broadcast, that they only had 6 days to produce the script and prepare for the broadcast (sounds like a typical way-too-fast marketing project to me!), but you never know, maybe that was in the back of Welles's mind.\nRegardless of the accuracy of the admission, Welles points out the concerning weaknesses that he saw in radio listeners that transfer perfectly to a soon-to-be AI saturated world. When we type in a Google search, we\u2019re used to that action being a somewhat reliable means of gathering good information. Now that an AI overview pops up as the first thing we see among search results, it may feel that the feature would also be authoritative\u2014it borrows the trust built from years of normal Google searching. But AI hallucinates (makes up information) even at times when it is critical to get accurate information. I\u2019ve heard people complain about trying to find events in large cities and AI has invented fake events including locations and times.\nThe lesson is hopefully clear: just because a machine says so, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s true, accurate, or authoritative. Just like the listeners to the\u00a0War of the Worlds\u00a0broadcast, we have the option to \u201cchange the channel\u201d to verify if what we\u2019ve found is real, but are we actually taking that option?\nEven worse is the concern of advertising taking the reins. Now, ads are starting to show up in the AI Overview section of search results in Google. While they are currently not being served through a bidding process like they normally are in search results and Google's support article says that you \u201ccan\u2019t directly target ad placements in the AI Overviews,\u201d that doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t be wary of what advertising\u00a0will\u00a0do. This matters because advertising has been a driving force for technological adoption and development, and has wide-reaching ability to sway culture and public thought. For example, the shift from radio to TV was directly related to advertising:\n\n\nAlthough some US advertisers expected television to boom, this was by no means a widespread conclusion. Why, then, did the dramatic content on US radio fade away so rapidly, disappearing almost entirely by 1960, while dramatic content has become a core part of US TV? Succinctly, it was because advertising moved from radio to TV. The soaps and serials that could have sustained radio moved along with the advertising onto TV.\n\n\u2014Revolution in the Echo Chamber, McMurtry, page 115\n\nThe Internet, I believe, is\u2014and has been for a while\u2014under a similarly tenuous position. What started as a place for experimentation, learning, and organization turned into a marketplace and an entertainment machine. Social media largely led the charge into the attention-harvesting, ad-selling digital environment we now inhabit.\n\n\nThe \u201cAmerican system\u201d of radio existed to help companies push products; audience attention was the commodity that broadcasters sold to advertisers. It was in the industry's best interest to maximize the size of its audiences, and this commercial imperative led broadcasters to produce a surfeit of variety shows, melodramas, and soap operas that were broadly appealing and inoffensive.\n\n\u2014Broadcast Hysteria, Schwartz, page 226\n\nRadio can thank the\u00a0War of the Worlds\u00a0broadcast as well as other programs and critiques for inspiring debates, pacts, and regulations about how it should be used, how to differentiate between news and entertainment, and how to protect the public\u2019s interests. The FCC eventually introduced the Fairness Doctrine in 1949 that required broadcasters to \u201cdevote some of their airtime to discussing controversial matters of public interest, and to air contrasting views regarding those matters.\u201d (Wikipedia, the Fairness Doctrine)\n\n\nThe Fairness Doctrine lasted almost forty years, until the FCC unanimously voted to do away with it in 1987. This gave broadcasters the freedom to tailor news content towards certain demographics, in order to maximize their ratings and appeal to advertisers. Instead of keeping everyone informed on the same topics, each audience would get its own information, slanted to reaffirm what it already believes. As a result, on too many issues Americans can no longer agree on which facts are really facts, on which news is true and which is fake...Too often, stories are crafted first and foremost to grab viewers, rather than to inform.\n\n\u2014Broadcast Hysteria, Schwartz, page 227\n\nCyborg\nI think that revisiting this story with empathy in mind is of crucial importance today because we are stewing in a very similar set of circumstances, and therefore we can draw some important lessons from the history. First of all, we can all participate in\u00a0designing\u00a0our technology. If we remain passive, then advertisers will design it for us. However, as the Fairness Doctrine demonstrated:\n\n\n\u2026the public interest ethos helped ensure that a protected space existed for artistic or informational shows that could not compete in the ratings, and American culture was better off because of it. Nowhere is the need for such a protected space clearer than in news broadcasting. When news is forced to compete for ratings, journalism all too easily gives way to sensationalism\u2026This can lead to a dangerous form of fake news with long-lasting repercussions.\n\n\u2014Broadcast Hysteria, Schwartz, page 226-227\n\nWithout careful, intentional policies, standards, and regulations, we are at the mercy of companies with different incentives than our own (expansion, customer loyalty/addiction, profits, and domination).\nFinally, I\u2019d like to revisit the situational factors specifically at play, which appear to be echoes from last century. Psychologist Hadley Cantril made the following insightful observations in 1940 in his book,\u00a0The Invasion from Mars\u00a0in which he looks at data from surveys and other research:\n\n\nProbably more important than anything else, the highly disturbed economic conditions many Americans have experienced for the past decade, the consequent unemployment, the prolonged discrepancies between family incomes, the inability of both young and old to plan for the future have endangered a widespread feeling of insecurity.\n\n\u2014page 203\n\nSound familiar? Let's keep going:\n\n\n\u201cProlonged bewilderment combined with lack of training to seek the basic causes of maladjustment are precisely the conditions most conducive to frustration and anxiety...Yet they desire an understanding and their desire increases with their perplexity. They become highly suggestible to some simple and sovereign formula provided by a demagogue. The whole tactics of Hitler show the importance he places on providing directed relief to bewildered souls. If they are not already sufficiently bewildered, bewilderment can be manufactured to sufficient propaganda.\n\u201cJust as there is little possibility that people will be wholly impervious to propaganda for war or for dictatorship until the basic economic and ideological conflicts causing wars and dictatorships are removed, so it would seem that there is little reason to expect people would be wholly insulated from panic-creating situations until the basic causes for panic are removed. It is not the radio, the movies, the press or \u201cpropaganda\u201d which, in themselves, really create wars and panics. It is the discrepancy between the whole superstructure of economic, social, and political practices and beliefs, and the basic and derived needs of individuals that creates wars, panics or mass movements of any kind.\u201d\n\n\u2014page 203-204\n\nSystems impact all of us, and technology is not the only kind of system. The weakening of our policies, of our commitments to standards and quality in information resources, of our intolerance for inhumanity all have contributed to our current situation\u2014not just in the U.S.\u2014and can have far-reaching effects in the distant future. It\u2019s difficult, but necessary to take stock of what is or might be influencing you and your perception of reality.\nBe careful out there.

A look at humanity through the hybrids on TV series, \"Alien Earth.\" \u00b6 A body lays on the cold metal table, her head is encircled by a plastic-looking structure\u2014not unlike a bedpan in shape and size\u2014which is glowing blue. She's dressed in what could be considered long-Johns or thermals. A child approaches the empty table beside the one the body occupies. This child, Marcy, has no hair, possibly because of chemo-therapy. She's about to take the first leap towards transhumanism by being digitally transferred from her frail, sick body into a synthetic, powerful one.\nThis is the beginning of a subplot in the new TV series, Alien Earth, and it is an exquisite exploration of humanity, self, and the consequences of technology interacting with both. No real spoilers here, so if you're still wanting to get started on the show (which I highly recommend if you can stand the gore and horror\u2014none of which will be in this newsletter), you should be pretty safe to read on...\nHybrids\nThere are a range of humanoid beings in the Alien universe, and Alien Earth specifies three from the first frame of the entire show:\n\nCyborgs: Humans with technological enhancements (human body and mind\u2014mostly)\nHybrids: Synthetic beings with human consciousness (previously human before downloading their consciousness into the new body)\nSynths: Synthetic beings with artificial intelligence (entirely non-human)\n\nThe hybrids in the show are the very first of their kind. They are the seemingly successful creations of a corporation called Prodigy, run by trillionaire man-child, Boy Kavalier. Boy's scientists and technologists created the synthetic bodies and to finish the experiment, they selected a small group of children with life-threatening diseases or debilitating conditions to undergo the transfer of consciousness from their bodies into their new &quot;immortal&quot; bodies.\nIt's an interesting concept: if it were possible to somehow duplicate your brain with some kind of series of snapshots that build the model of your consciousness in the digital realm, is a download all that is really needed at that point? I mean, if you, yourself, are simply a collection of memories and goals, then who knows? This could be a possibility in the distant future.\nAh, but here we have already come to the philosophical snag in the concept of hybrids: is that truly the entire self? Some musty, imperfect memories and a collection of weird impulses to pursue intellectually or physically? In addition to the concern that this is not all that creates our &quot;self,&quot; there is the question of whether the process of transfer would remove our humanity. Meaning, is our humanity also linked to our human bodies? Are these hybrids still humans after the process? Are they even the same people that they were before, just in a different body?\nCo-executive producer of Alien Earth, Migizi Pensoneau, shared some thoughts on the show's official podcast that are helpful. (Yes, my surprising and sudden obsession with this show runs deep...)\n\n\n&quot;My personal opinion on the humanity of a hybrid is that I just wrote them as humans...You're writing these characters not as the sort of synthetic bodies or the way that they're perceived, but you...melt that away and you get down to the fact that these are kids going through this new experience that nobody before them has ever been through.&quot;\n\n\u2014Alien Earth - The Official Podcast, episode 1\n\nOk, so he seemed to see the humanity in these hybrid characters, and I would agree from the portrayal in the show. The hybrids pass the Turing test when Marcy's brother says she feels like his sister, though something like our HADD bias may still be at play, tricking us into seeing what we want to see. \nPensoneau adds one more variable to the complexity of this issue of humanity, that I think is particularly important:\n\n\n...it's really our consciousness, our sense of self that makes a human human. And for me, I would take it one step further that it's not just our relationship to ourself or the awareness of us having a self, but instead it is a relationship to others and how we care for or how we feel about others. That connection to another person, another being, another creature or whatever...we are connected on some level to other beings around us. And I think that the hybrids, even though their bodies are synthetic, their consciousness is constantly reaching out towards others...that was enough for me to say they're human.&quot;\n\n\u2014Alien Earth - The Official Podcast, episode 2\n\nSelf\nThe uncomfortable part of philosophizing about one's Self is that things get confusing (I blame Prototype Theory, in part). The moment we start drawing lines around concepts, the less we get out of the concepts. For example, if my Self, my consciousness, is wholly dependent upon my likes, dislikes, memories, goals, and even my autonomy, then how am I any different than a rat or a moth? Humans are social creatures, so it makes sense that part of our humanity would not just include our concept of Self, but also our relationships to others (human and non-human alike). As soon as we introduce other Selves, they start to influence my Self\u2014so where is the line of my Self, separate from other Selves?\nMaybe it's that fixation on trying to draw boundaries that is the root of the issue. We are not healthy in total isolation of others. We are made of the ancestors that came before, the contemporary humans we interact with, and our own Self also influences and interacts with our contemporaries and our genetic circumstances.\nReverend Elizabeth M. Edman wrote an excellent examination of the tension between our own Self and the Other in her book, Queer Virtue:\n\n\nOne way people get it wrong is by radicalizing the separation of Self and Other. Perhaps the worst version of this happens when the Other becomes cast not just as different, but despised...The Despised Other is someone who has become so alien to you that you stop being able to conceive of that person as human.\n\npage 22\n\n\n\nThe inverse of the Despised Other would be the collapse of those categories as distinct at all. Co-opting the Other into one's Self can be a profoundly abusive act. Sometimes the collapse is the result of a kind of suffocating faux love. Sometimes it is born of privilege that simply fails to perceive that there are others present who are markedly different...Either way, as with the invention of the Despised Other, the end result is an erasure of the Other's humanity, rendering a person or community invisible or nonexistent. \nThese are extreme situations, to be sure, but the fundamental balancing act in navigating the relationship between Self and Other exists for all of us. You and I could come up with hundreds of daily, mundane situations in which clarity about Self and Other is something that you have to figure out, outcomes that affect your well-being or the well-being of another person. Understanding and negotiating one's sense of self and one's connection to others, drawing appropriate boundaries while maintaining necessary interconnection, is of vital importance. Getting it right, maybe the core ethical challenge of the human condition.\n\npage 22-23\n\n...and that's all with just plain old humans in human bodies.\nWhile I love getting confounded by these philosophical puzzles, I also worry that we get distracted by science fiction as we argue about the humanity of some invented character in an invented world. I worry because I see it in myself: anger and injury leading me to deny the humanity of other humans\u2014even the truly awful humans. I'd rather sit in a haze thinking about whether a consciousness keeps its initial humanity as it transfers to another body than reconsider how I am currently talking about a harmful public figure or politician.\nSo I echo Reverend Edman's words, if only to try and convince myself to remember: &quot;Understanding and negotiating one's sense of self and one's connection to others, drawing appropriate boundaries while maintaining necessary interconnection, is of vital importance.&quot;\nCyborg\nAs actual science is catching up with science fiction, we find new applications for these metaphors. While we don't need to be overly concerned with hybrids in the real world right now, the idea of hybrids can still help us work out issues that we are facing right now.\nThe more I consider what makes hybrids human or not helps me work out my own humanity. What makes me human? What values do I want to express? What are the things I cannot lose, because their loss would remove my own humanity?\nInterestingly enough, just like the squishy boundaries of considering Self and Other, as I consider humanity I find myself in a more expansive state that includes more than just humans. We are part of an environment with other life forms and my actions\u2014even my existence\u2014affect the world around me.\nThe implication in Alien Earth is that this transfer of consciousness only goes one way: one of the scientists remarks that worst case, they just killed a bunch of kids. Sometimes it feels like we are also going through this process of transfer as the digital realm continuously pulls us back to it. However, we have a unique option available to us with our current real-life technology. We can move to the digital environment, but we can also move back into our bodies and interact with the real world again. \nWe aren't trapped in the synthetic, altered state that corporations would prefer for us to be trapped in. Right now we can still make the choice to be embodied humans and enjoy what that means for good and bad, health and sickness. We can still make the choice to see the humanity in every human, even though the digital realm often encourages the opposite.\nWhat makes up your humanity?

I'm gripping a cold plastic handle, finger resting immediately on a trigger. My sister is wrapped up in a huge blanket and we're both surrounded with pillows. Choral music begins to play from the surround-sound speakers and the huge screen in front of us displays the logo that first showed me how cool typography (specifically custom type) could be:\nHalo: Combat Evolved\nIt's a silly thing, but it's one of my favorite experiences growing up. Playing this intense alien-shooter game in our parents' super scary basement with my best friend is about the most nostalgic thing I can think of.\nSurprisingly enough, this game has a lot to do with themes we've been exploring in CYBORG_ recently: horror, Alien (the movie franchise), religion + technology, monstrosity, artificial intelligence (AI), and art. The game bleeds into our reality, not just through concepts and ideas, but the central AI character, Cortana, was the design inspiration for Microsoft's personal assistant (2009-2023) and in my opinion a fantastic marketing ploy.\nSecure your suits and load your ammo, this is gonna go deep...space.\nNihilism\nFor a game with such in-your-face Christian names (Halo, The Covenant, The Flood, Master Chief), the actual feeling is an almost nihilistic, empty hopelessness. This is perhaps a poetic reflection of outer space itself, which is the setting of the game. While the &quot;last frontier&quot; is beautiful, inspiring, and full of potential, it also holds deeply disturbing horrors. I'm talking about actual horrors: being stranded in space is probably the most helpless you could possibly be. Then of course, we can thank imaginative horrors like the Alien franchise to fill in the potential things to be found in the vast, real universe. Who knows if there are other life forms\u2014or diseases\u2014out there that could interrupt or discontinue our current reality if found and brought to earth?\nThe game pops us right into the middle of some kind of galactic struggle. We're awakened from a cryogenic sleep in response to our ship being boarded by the hostile multi-species alien alliance called The Covenant. At first, there's not much that we know besides, &quot;Me have gun, they have gun, start shooting.&quot;\nThe religious themes start to develop even further as we start putting together the larger story pieces. There's a whole history of an ideological conflict between two ancient species that ends up producing the conflict we're engaged in: The Forerunners vs. The Flood. The Covenant believe they are the successors to the Forerunners (who are now extinct), and have fanatically taken up &quot;The Mantle&quot; to be the caretakers of the universe. But to understand any of this, we first have to make it to the ring-world, Halo.\n&quot;Whoever controls Halo controls the fate of the universe,&quot; Cortana, our AI companion, informs us. We are led to believe that Halo is simply a weapon that the Covenant plan to use against humans. Not so! Halo is actually a fail-safe that will eradicate all sentient life in the worst-case scenario that The Flood (another alien force) get loose. The Covenant aliens are prepared to sacrifice all lives\u2014theirs, ours, and almost everything else\u2014in order to starve the Flood into extinction. \nHere's where this gets interesting.\nThe Flood is a zombie-like force\u2014technically separate entities, but also controlled and connected as if it were one organism. We first see the Flood emerge when the game goes from fun alien-shooter to horror-survival\u2013shooter. Tons of little aliens start to swarm and when they find corpses of any kind or other temporarily live characters, they infect the bodies and turn them into grotesque zombies that then attack you.\nThis surprise mid-way through the game introduces the nihilism that pervades the lore. It's no longer just aliens vs. humans, because the Flood is voracious and makes no distinction between food options. There are times throughout the game series that humans team up with Covenant forces against the Flood. Ultimately, it feels hopeless and pointless, because the Flood just keeps coming. They multiply with every fallen soldier and sometimes reanimate their own corpses.\nIt's a true Romero-style zombie in which you are forced to face an ever-growing crowd. Individuals may not be hard to get rid of, but the true power comes in the masses. The Flood is the perfect name for this force\u2014unstoppable, uncontrollable, and continuously expanding\u2014and of course it pulls in more Biblical references. The Flood is destruction, and except for some ancient speculative technologies, there is no deliverance.\nTrapped in a war with forces greater than any individual, history longer than generations, and never-ending swarms of foes, every bit of meaning eventually falls away and survival takes the place of any other concerns. This aspect of the game feels like our current political situation in the U.S.: decisions, fanaticism, and ideologies that are larger than just you or me are playing out a conflict that we both do and do not impact. The social and political systems continue on as if they are cosmic beings clashing and destroying parts of our realities at different times.\nLimbo\nAs I brushed up on the lore for Halo, I realized something about the game's environmental design that was validated in a video about why Halo is so creepy: it's full of liminal spaces.\n\n    \n    An empty room filtering into a shorter hallway in a brutalist-style concrete environment.\n    \n\nWe end up exploring various environments that are devoid of life aside from the Covenant or Flood. Technically even the plant life in the &quot;outside&quot; areas of the Halo ring-world is contrived. The whole world is constructed, not necessarily natural. Then when we explore the deep architecture beneath the surface, we find ourselves in spaces that can feel very tight, or extremely vast.\n\n    \n    More concrete-like walls and floors, but this hallway is eerily tall.\n    \n\n&quot;Liminal spaces&quot; here includes a sense of dread that is felt in spaces that are &quot;in-between.&quot; In a way, this is the &quot;monstrous&quot; side of architecture. Humans tend to consider other humans or things that break categories as monsters. Zombies, for example, are human, but also not human. They're alive even though they're supposed to be dead. Same with liminal spaces. Those spooky hallways in hotels or the dark and stuffy stairwells that take you to a parking lot are spaces that exist as connections, not destinations. They're places, but they're uncomfortable\u2014especially when they're empty, no one around but you (as far as you can tell).\nHalo uses these liminal space environments to great effect. Tight interconnected and repeating hallways increase the dread as you take every turn just waiting for the jump scare you know is going to show at some point. Vast spaces don't remove the dread either, because they can suddenly fill with the Flood, chasing you down as if in a nightmare where you run and run, but respite is always still farther ahead.\nThe Ultimate Betrayal\nWhile trying to work out what's going on, kill enemies, and save your own skin, there's one aspect of the story that has been subtly hiding in plain sight. AI has been a part of our journey every step of the way (literally, since Cortana gets ported into our helmet and speaks to us intermittently as we play). Halfway through the game (at the same time we start learning about the Flood), we get separated from Cortana as she gets put into the Halo Control Center and alerts us to go save some fellow humans. That's where we meet 343 Guilty Spark (I'll call him the Monitor from here on out). The Monitor is an AI housed in a box-like case that can float and teleport. \nThe whole game to this point, we have been given no hint that AI can't be trusted. So when the Monitor tells us how to activate Halo's defenses to stop the Flood, we go right along with it. Just as we are about to activate the literal kill-switch, Cortana re-emerges from the control center terminal and stops us, revealing the truth of what we were about to do. Finally, the Monitor admits the consequences of its instructions:\n\n&quot;Technically this installation pulse has a maximum effective radius of 25,000 lightyears but once the others follow suit, this galaxy will be quite devoid of life\u2014or at least any life with sufficient biomass to sustain the Flood, but you already knew that. I mean, how couldn't you?...We have followed outbreak containment procedure to the letter. You were with me each step of the way as we managed this crisis.&quot;\n\nInitially understood as a benign guardian of the ancient technology of Halo, the Monitor has been revealed as having less-than-transparent motives at best, at worst it is a maniacal AI bent on destroying all sentient life (and it proceeds to try and kill you for the rest of the game, so...).\nThe Flood was the first big surprise of this game, and this sudden betrayal was the second. The game was released in 2001, so from my experience of feeling like computers were trustworthy machines that would guide humanity to all things good, having an AI antagonist was deeply disconcerting. However, this clearly reflects realities that are now playing out in real-world AI. Motivations may not be the right word, but incentives certainly apply to the behavior of AI models. Incentives are driving the development of the models (felt by the companies creating them) and incentives drive the models' output (the more you engage is likely the &quot;reward&quot; that an AI model is seeking).\nAI is not an impartial arbiter of truth and goodness. Not in the game, not in real life, and hopefully not ever.\nIn a way, the artificial intelligences in the game feel like manifestations of that original ancient conflict: The Forerunner alien civilization with its own priorities and values against human civilization with our priorities and values. Cortana is a hero in her own right throughout the game series and even tugs on heartstrings as you develop a relationship with her. The Monitor with its agenda manipulates us and hinders our progress. Even now, it's tough for me to refer to Cortana as an &quot;it&quot; instead of a &quot;her,&quot; demonstrating how much of a relationship we developed, even knowing it's a game.\nThe seemingly innocent themes of our relationship to/with AI in these games is uncomfortable to me now that our current reality has given us these very opportunities. So, in a way, Halo has taught me an important lesson about AI: trust must be earned, but it is a fragile thing. \nIn real life, my current opinion is to avoid any possibility of forming a &quot;relationship&quot; with AI. The risks are not even close to the possible benefits. AI is ultimately a manifestation of its creator's context\u2014it inherits traits, biases, and agendas as a result of its creation, and that alone is enough to dissuade me from putting any kind of real trust in it. If a company is incentivized (as they currently all are) to maximize our engagement with their AI models, it doesn't matter how friendly, how heroic and Cortana-like the model appears, it simply cannot have your best interest &quot;at heart&quot; because it is trying to keep you in relationship to itself.\nWe have not yet created Cortanas, all we have at present are Monitors\u2014friendly faces on black boxes.\nCyborg\nThis nostalgic game turned out to be much deeper than I thought. It explores so much of how technology impacts our actual lives. Something as simple as the design of a building can impact our mood or our feeling of safety, as we saw in the liminal spaces exploiting our dread in the game.\nThe interesting thing about the Christian-religious themes throughout the game is that humans aren't really a part of it, aside from your character acting as a savior figure. You could map the idea of a cosmic struggle between good and evil onto the Forerunner/Covenant vs. Flood conflict...and yet, humans just get in the way in the minds of the Covenant. Is it really good vs. evil? When you can't see yourself in a religious mythology, it changes everything. Although The Flood pose an actual threat to all life, does the religious story imposed on the threat really justify the violent genocide and suicide?\nAI pulling the strings as an over-arching plot device is another aspect that reaches deeply into our fears. Apparently having a &quot;human in the loop,&quot; simply isn't enough if AI can avoid being transparent about its guidance. \nWe are as easily manipulated by machines as we are by ideologies and religious fanaticism. When misunderstandings are codified into religious rites and traditions, it becomes very difficult to sort out what is true and what is moral. We see this bleeding into the rhetoric and opinions about our technology in the real world (I would include politics as a part of that &quot;technology&quot;).\n\n\n...the aliens see the Forerunners as gods, and fancy themselves to be their successors. Since the Forerunners were able to build the Halo installations, it is safe to assume they were a highly advanced species. The fact that the Covenant holds the technology left behind by this ancient civilisation to be sacred might mean that it is in fact technology itself they are worshipping.\n\n\u2014The Dark of the Covenant, by P.C.J.M. (Jarell) Paulissen (2018), Tilburg School of Catholic Theology\n\nIn a world full of paradoxes, it's important to continuously check in with yourself: what are my values? Am I living in harmony with those values? How can I work to see the humanity in those around me\u2014especially those who are in-between or don't fit my preferred categories of human?\nInstead of raising our blasters against monsters, we should look for ways to dismantle the desire to demonize found within ourselves.

I am unable to pull myself away from all of the Alien movies and the new show, Alien Earth. It's been puzzling me because it's been so captivating, and I think I'm seeing an interesting connection between our real world problems and my fascination with the discomfort and disgust of these horrible stories. \nWe Used to Be Food\nOne of the moments at the very beginning of the Alien Earth series that gave me serious pause for reflection was this little observation from the synthetic chief scientist, Kirsh:\n\nYou used to be food, you know.\nHumanity.\nYour lives were short and filled with fear. Then your brains grew. You built tools and used them to conquer nature. You built impossible machines and went to space. You stopped being food.\nOr, I should say, you told yourself you weren't food anymore.\nBut in the animal kingdom, there is always someone bigger or smaller who would eat you alive if they had the chance. That's what it is to be an animal. You're born. You live. You die.\n\nIt's chilling to think that even in this big world that we've created around us, it still doesn't shield us from nature. Rarely, that means those bigger or fiercer creatures that you could run into by chance, but maybe more often it's the nature of the micro-scale: the disease, the virus, or even systemic issues from the environment to our own bodies.\nDon't get me wrong, at least in the wealthiest countries, we have done so much to improve the quality of our lives, to be able to have a relatively low infant mortality rate, to have vaccines that promote the health of communities, to be able to slow the progression of incurable diseases. And it's not enough. \nTo help explain, I lean on a grotesque scene in the second episode of Alien Earth (I'll spare the gory details and keep it light). A ship has crashed into a huge building on Earth, carrying several species of aliens, including the infamous xenomorph (the beautifully designed creature from the Alien franchise), which obviously escapes from the crashed spaceship to terrorize and kill everything it can find in the building.\nA rescue team is sent in to try and find any injured people from the crash and assess the scene. One medic, Joe Hermit, gets separated while being chased by the xenomorph. He manages to evade the monster and gets to the 65th floor of the building and reunites with another search party soldier. They find a room full of people dressed in Victorian garb\u2014curly white-haired wigs, puffy sleeves, corsets and all. These are wealthy elites, sitting mindlessly at the top of their tower, complaining about all of the noise caused by the spaceship crashing into the building.\n&quot;Well I'm sure if it's a real problem, Boy Kavalier will call me personally. We belong to the same club,&quot; the man the script calls &quot;His Lordship&quot; says as he ignores the soldier and medic's attempts at getting them to evacuate. The xenomorph conveniently reveals itself shortly after the absurd scene and lays waste to all of the foolish rich people in their fancy outfits. You can almost hear the message: Your money means nothing.\nWe used to be food. We decided we weren't going to be anymore. But are we really any different than how we started?\nFeel free to skip this next paragraph if you don't want the image in your head, I include it for those who have seen the show:\nTo drive this point home even further, the episode puts up two horrible, parallel shots. The first is with the rescue crew that gets into the wrecked spaceship. They find a cat aboard that has been so badly injured that it drags itself along the floor with its two front paws. Later at the 65th floor dinner party, His Lordship is seen crawling in the same manner\u2014legs no longer part of his body. Man and animal in precise harmony.\nRefuge\nTechnology has been touted for so long as a saving force. We know there is a lot of Western Christian imagery and themes that are bound into our current set of technology. Tech is often talked about as if it were a serpent on a staff, raised to save those who would simply look upon it, or maybe it's the Savior figure himself: the incomprehensible solution to every problem.\nThe world is a scary place and nature acts as an inscrutable, impersonal, violent force. It giveth and it taketh away\u2014then it destroyeth and decayeth. Sometimes nature feels like an encounter with the xenomorph. \n\n\nThe inexorable laws of nature alone will do nicely to crush my own egotistical sense of power in the world, and I don't need to read the universal uncontrollable forces as being transcendental or wholly other. This is why, I think, the biological monsters created by H.R. Giger in Ridley Scott's film Alien are so horrific: we are as helpless (at least in the first three acts) in the face of these natural selection machines as we are before any traditional deity...\n\n\u2014On Monsters, Stephen T. Asma, 192\n\nI think this tension between the harshness of the natural world and the parallel, but at least human-made, technological world is what makes these movies and aliens so attention-grabbing to me. \nThere is a sense of control in our technology: I feel empowered every time I get something I've programmed working. I turn on a fan when I feel too warm in my office. I fill up my water bottle from inside my own home when I'm thirsty. These are incredible, unthinkably powerful things. I also have a disease (multiple sclerosis) that I carry with me, that may lash out at me at any unsuspecting moment. The weather can destroy my home or threaten my safety. Something as simple and tiny as a virus could kill me from within.\nThe safety and comfort of technology surrounds me, and yet I know I'm still a vulnerable little animal at my core. That puts me on edge. It's not the ever-present potential of threat that a squirrel might experience out in the wild, it's a subtle anxiety that hides in the shadows of my thoughts: What if?\n\n\nMonsters of contemporary horror are not like their medieval counterparts, who were more like God's henchman. That older paradigm held out the inevitability of monstrous defeat by divine justice, but the contemporary monster is often a reminder of theological abandonment and the accompanying angst. Nor are the more recent horror monsters like the monsters of the Enlightenment, products of human superstition that can be conquered by the light of reason. Monsters after Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and Freud are features of the irrevocable irrationality inside the human subject and outside in nature.\n\nOn Monsters, 202\n\nCyborg\nThe point here is not exacerbate our anxieties, but to also try and avoid being the idiotic, clueless cos-players at the 65th floor dinner party. When we become too insulated and too used to our wealth or privilege, we become vulnerable to the surprises of nature. The fix is not to become overly anxious nor to become draconic hoarders. I think part of the fix is the opposite: gratitude and resource-sharing.\nGratitude is noticing that the water flows cleanly and reliably from the tap. Gratitude is noticing that the dark, scary, spider-filled part of the garage can be illuminated with a light switch or a flashlight. Gratitude says, I have enough, then considers, Maybe I have more than enough, and I can share.\nResource-sharing is not just about your individual contributions, though of course that is valuable and impressive. When I think about the current real-life threats to modern humans, disease and AI are the biggest threats that come to mind, but I'm starting to wonder if we need more focus on disease right now. Consider these two examples from Jonathan Kennedy's excellent research:\n\n\nTuberculosis was another major killer in the slums of industrializing Europe, but it declined in high-income countries as living and working conditions improved, antibiotics were developed and national immunization programs were introduced in the mid-twentieth century. And yet, despite the fact that there is a cheap and reasonably effective vaccine available...it is still the most deadly infectious disease in the world. It kills about 1.2 million people a year, almost all of whom live in lower- and middle-income countries.\n\n\u2014Pathogenesis, Jonathan Kennedy, (2023), pg 206\n\n\n\nBecause COVID-19 is such an infectious pathogen, the hoarding of vaccines is not just callous selfishness on the part of high income countries: it is potentially a massive own goal that could very well prolong the pandemic and increase the likelihood of new, more dangerous variants emerging. \n\n\u2014Pathogenesis, 224\n\nWealth absolutely shields us from a lot of issues, day-to-day dangers, and diseases in general, but it is not infallible. I'm convinced that the greater the disparity between the rich and the poor\u2014at whatever scale you want to look at, global or local\u2014the greater the risk to all people, regardless of wealth.\nRather than learning from the COVID-19 pandemic we barely got through, we have watched politicians and other actors gut the very institutions that are at the forefront of public health. Programs like USAID were destroyed, which helped world-wide health initiatives\u2014not only saving lives, but doing the work that's needed to keep pathogenic threats at bay. We are dressing ourselves up in ignorant, fancy clothes and insulating ourselves in a dinner party far from the inconveniences of &quot;lesser&quot; people.\nWhen we as a society turn away and turn inward, are we setting ourselves up to becoming the food again? Not to the xenomorph. This time, it's not &quot;someone bigger&quot; that will take the advantage of our vulnerability.

In stunning displays of setting expectations and then dashing them to pieces, the show goes through several characters' backstories that could explain the kidnapping of the main character's son. Every woman from the mother to her friend who hired a nanny for her own child becomes suspicious, and then is quickly absolved as more information comes in.\nThere's one more character that ruptures stereotype and expectations: the disabled brother of the main character's husband. Brian, the brother-in-law, is clearly in pain for most of the show as he hobbles on crutches. At one point, the show reveals that Brian could absolutely be using a wheelchair, but because of the shame and pressure he experiences from his siblings, he instead opts for pain killers that make him ill, and continues on using the crutches that make the pain killers necessary. \nBrian suffers in the background for most of show until the truth starts to come out to clarify the real guilty party. This person evades suspicion by masterfully blaming and manipulating everyone else. Brian had been told by the malignant character that he was unqualified for a surgery that would significantly improve his quality of life. Luckily for Brian, his neurologist calls him personally at one point and gives him the news that he actually is a perfect candidate for the surgery. After realizing he had been lied to by someone he had always trusted, Brian takes to his wheelchair and abandons the vicious cycle of crutches and painkillers.\n&quot;What...are you doing in your chair?&quot; Brian's sister asks.\n&quot;Newsflash to everyone here: I like my chair...Most disabled people actually kind of dig their wheelchairs. To all of you, this chair is a trap, but to me, it's freedom. I can actually get places,&quot; he answers firmly.\nBrian's family projected their own feelings about the wheelchair onto his experience with the chair. Instead of letting him choose what was best for him, they pressured him to fake being more able than he was and to actively abandon the one thing that could have helped him the most, which led to further, needless suffering. \nIt's important to check our assumptions about other people's lives, preferences, needs, and adaptations. Instead of looking at a disabled person and feeling sad or going up to them to tell them they're an inspiration (please don't ever do that, almost everyone hates that), we need to stop and honor the space that they are in, and who they are as a person. Don't let discomfort interrupt your ability to see them as a human being.\nThere's also a tension here that lurks in the shadows of our discomfort. It has something to do with circles, cages, and apparently wheelchairs. I'll pass it to Marshall McLuhan and Quentin Fiore, who wrote in their book, The Medium Is the Massage, the following observation about perception and detention (and, yes, it's supposed to be &quot;massage&quot; as a pun, not a typo!):\n\n\n&quot;A cell for citters to cit in.&quot;\nThe idea of detention in a closed space as a form of human punitive corrective action seems to have come in very much in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries\u2014 at the time perspective and pictorial space was developing in our Western world.\n\n\u2014The Medium Is the Massage, Marshall McLuhan &amp; Quentin Fiore, 1967, page 61\n\nThe fact that a wheelchair looks like prison\u2014a punishment\u2014to some, but for others (usually the people who actually need the chair) it looks like freedom, makes me wonder if there's a connection between this idea of closed spatial perception and punishment that is even more pervasive than we may be aware. If McLuhan and Fiore are right, then we may also be unknowingly influenced by ideas and perceptions that formed a few centuries ago, which can only be reformed if noticed and understood.\nCircles\nShapes don't necessarily mean anything, but they can cause intuitive feelings in us. For example, a shape with precise, sharp corners doesn't feel as friendly as the same shape does with rounded corners. Many web-design sessions I've watched have expressed this &quot;friendliness&quot; of rounded corners, such as when designing buttons on a site, or putting rectangular images on the page. It just feels nicer to round those off, as though having the squared corners might cut you.\nFrom my group art therapy experience as well as listening to others describe their feelings about visuals, I've noticed that circles tend to be associated with positive things: completeness/wholeness, balance, peace, eternity. Paradoxically, however, circles can also bring up bad feelings, like being stuck. In English, we even have a phrase, &quot;I feel like I'm going in circles,&quot; to describe the sensation of being unable to change something\u2014maybe even feeling powerless and without freedom. \nAdam Walker released a fascinating video, The Age of Closed Circles, in which he argues that we are currently in a society with a desperate need of a new &quot;renaissance.&quot; Taking inspiration from Valentin Tomberg and somewhat from Rainer Maria Rilke's poem, The Panther, Walker explains that there are &quot;closed circles&quot; by which we are ultimately enslaved.\n\n\n&quot;Thoreau knew that within closed circles, a life will run its unconscious course around a fixed point until it expires. And these closed circles are now being fashioned by algorithms, by Al, by the market and you see people really consumed in these circles today in a way that's entirely exploitative.&quot;\n\n\u2014Walker, apx 04:15\n\nHere we can see our paradox forming: we have these enclosed spaces (circles), that can be both imprisonment and freedom at the same time. Technology, for example, helps us to lead better, healthier lives, and it can also trap us in infinite loops of anxiety or entertainment. We are simultaneously more connected and more isolated. \n&quot;...a life will run its unconscious course around a fixed point until it expires,&quot; immediately reminded me of Speedy, the robot, found in Isaac Asimov's, I, Robot. In all of the stories in that book, Asimov puts a robot in conflict with his defined, &quot;Three Laws of Robotics,&quot; which are the logical rules that each bot must follow. Speedy was sent to gather information about a selenium pool to help with a mining station on Mercury. However, Speedy ends up going in continuous circles around the pool, because the rules are incompatible in the situation: it must follow the orders it was given, but it must not endanger itself. In my mind, I see a robot zooming along the terrain, unable to get closer to complete the assignment due to the dangerous environment, and unable to abandon the area (again, because it can't disobey the orders given). Without intervention, the bot would have indeed run its unconscious course until it expired. \nIn Rilke's poem, The Panther, we see an animal behaving in a similar way. The panther makes the rounds in its cage. Maybe you've seen this yourself at a zoo: a magnificent animal, pacing, retracing steps until a track is defined on the enclosure's floor. It's hard not to see it as imprisonment.\n\n\n&quot;...ein gro\u00dfer Wille steht.&quot; / &quot;...a mighty will stands paralyzed.&quot;\n\n(Stanza 2, Stephen Mitchell translation)\n\nWalker suggests the &quot;shape&quot; we actually want is still circular, but it isn't closed\u2014it's an ascending spiral. Instead of being trapped in the perpetual &quot;Merry Go 'Round&quot; ride, we are ideally scaling a mountain with our curling path. To move from the closed loop to the spiral, we need something to cause or permit a break; a renaissance. \nPrison Break\nI included this weird quote earlier from The Medium is the Massage:\n\n&quot;A cell for citters to cit in.&quot;\n\nIt's at the top of the page and has no other explanation (or citation) aside from the context. Admittedly, I was worried that &quot;cit&quot; might be a crude word, but the Oxford English Dictionary suggests it's more of a term for a person from the city. Some of my family members may use the more common term, &quot;city slickers,&quot; which I think could be considered a modern synonym since &quot;cit&quot; doesn't seem to have a very positive connotation. \nThis quote, then, is very much a pun and even plays with the English sounds. To my ear, I hear &quot;a cell for sitters to sit in,&quot; and it makes me think of someone sitting cross-legged on the ground in prison. So if we're talking about a prison cell for &quot;citters&quot; (city folk) to &quot;cit in&quot; (be about their city business?), then maybe this phrase is pointing out another paradoxical situation of simultaneous freedom and imprisonment. \nI think it's important to take a look at the symbols we have in front of us and to question our assumptions about them. Maybe we look at a wheelchair and all we see is restriction. That doesn't mean that a wheelchair means &quot;trap&quot; for everyone\u2014it does mean &quot;freedom&quot; for many, many people. Living in the city, having a 9-5 job, participating on social media, and so many more choices, circumstances, and privileges all have positive and negative consequences.\nThe point here isn't to try and identify things or ideas that are &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad,&quot; because when we abstract and moralize, we tend to stay in our closed circle. Just changing your mind about a wheelchair does not break us out of the pattern of judging every item as we encounter it, despite having seen that our judgments hold no power beyond our own experience (except in cases where we exert our judgment to knowingly or unknowingly take agency from someone else). I think the way we break this path is to realize the dual nature of everything. There are few things at the true ends of the spectrum of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad,&quot; and most things are somewhere in the middle.\nWisdom is not about defining good and bad in isolation (the wheelchair means prison), wisdom takes context (the wheelchair can mean freedom). \n\nI do want to offer a final space for reflection on the real prisons and circumstances of detainment, arrest, and captivity. Many of us have the privilege of imagining imprisonment without any likelihood of experiencing it. Far too many people are wrongfully detained and imprisoned in the U.S. prison system (see The New Jim Crow by Michelle Alexander for an excellent look at this gut-wrenching issue). The horrors of ICE terrorism currently being perpetrated are far beyond any metaphorical idea of imprisonment I'm discussing here. If you want to take action for those who are being brutalized, terrorized, and unlawfully harassed, take a moment today to call your reps.

My hackles were raised and I sensed an intense danger. I ran into a room and slammed the heavy door shut. I know this door: it's tricky to lock, so I examined the crack between door and frame, lifting the bottom slightly so that I can see the mechanics as they click into place. Deadbolt slides smoothly, and I take my first deep breath. The handle shakes violently and the door shudders as someone throws themselves at it.\nI know who's on the other side. It's a balding, middle-aged man. The remaining thin hair splashes across his head and around his temples, reflecting his own unpredictable, intemperate behavior. He's dangerous and he wants to kill me.\nI back away from the door and wince as the old wood floor creaks. He still fiddles with the doorknob, but it's getting quieter. A chill sneaks through my nervous system when I realize what room I'm in: the mudroom / sunroom that connects to the garage. That means there's another door I've neglected. I turn around and sneak over to that door, locking and pulling the chain up and into its slot. Now I can breathe this time. I'm safe.\nTurning back to the original door, I take a few quiet steps. It's not quiet enough now that the doorknob has been still\u2014I hadn't noticed the silence in my panic to secure the back door. My eyes lock onto the dull, wide-eyed gaze of the man from under the crack. He had laid down on the floor and watched me this whole time.\nPanic creeps back in. The space between the floor and the bottom of the door grows larger until I can see his whole face. He can fit under the door\u2014and he smiles wide as I realize this. I have a heavy blue and white vase in my hands and I prepare to slam it on his head as he crawls toward me.\n&quot;Are you ok?&quot;\nI wake up completely confused and scared. I don't trust what I am seeing. It seems to be my room as I left it last night\u2014but I was just in a room that felt familiar and correct, despite it being completely incorrect to reality's architecture.\nTrying to calm myself and detangle reality from imagination, I get one last total-body chill of fear despite being in actual safety. The mere memory of my dream taking its final toll for my nighttime travels.\nNightmare Science?\nNightmares such as the one I described above have haunted me for the last few years\u2014not necessarily in frequency, but in intensity. Prior to the 2020 pandemic, I don't recall very many times where I would remember my dreams at all, let alone be awoken whimpering in fear or fighting for my life to escape from some terrific threat. \nIf something like a nightmare can be that intense, does it mean something?\nI was surprised to find relatively little useful material for understanding nightmares outside of a diagnosis or condition linked to nightmares. In the abstract of the study, &quot;Nightmares in the general population&quot; (2017),  it backs me up a little bit, saying: &quot;Nightmares are inherently distressing, prevent restorative sleep, and are associated with a number of psychiatric problems, but have rarely been the subject of empirical study.&quot;\nFrom the Epic of Gilgamesh to the Bible, it seems like we humans have pretty consistently considered dreams in some kind of supernatural terms. We either have some kind of prophecy framework to interpret them through (e.g. my dream is an omen about the future), or we have a Freudian interpretation framework that still relies heavily on symbolism and subjectivity. \nDr. Ernest Jones made this observation about nightmares:\n\n&quot;It is not often realised that most descriptions of Nightmare given by its victims are an inarticulate and feeble echo of the dread reality. This is one result of the general human tendency to shun deep emotions whenever possible, leading to an imperfect appreciation of the intensity of mental suffering.&quot;\n\u2014On the Nightmare (1959),  by Ernest Jones, M.D., pg 13-14\n\n...although the rest of the book explores how medieval monsters (werewolves, vampires, hags, etc.) may have some bearing on how we understand nightmares. His pragmatic insight on our discomfort with deep emotions is still ultimately linked to the supernatural, even if only by the lay-person's conceptualizations, superstitions, and religious influences.\nI was able to find an intriguing non-Freudian proposal from Henry Kellerman about when nightmares occur:\n\n&quot;The nightmare is triggered only if a specific emotion-defense is impaired along with an impairment of some disorganization to dreamwork mechanisms so that these mechanisms are inoperative. In such a case the emotion is disregulated, while the primary-process material of a latent dream is similarly unregulated. Under such conditions, the highest intensity of the emotion is experienced, and the dreamer awakens.&quot;\n\u2014The Nightmare: Psychological and Biological Foundations (1987), edited by Henry Kellerman, pg 279\n\nOk, so we still have a bunch of jargon that basically says the same thing: nightmares are intense, we find them alongside our deepest emotions, and we can't escape the strangeness or &quot;supernatural&quot; structures that come with all dreams.\nMaybe that's actually kind of cool because, as we've seen from the development of technology, supernatural themes like religion, monstrosity, and other anxiety-inducing metaphors emerge just like what I'm finding with dreams. Of course, please consult with your mental health professional if you are experiencing distress whether because of nightmares or any other causes. I'm no expert here, but I am seeing some interesting threads to pull for exploration's sake\u2014not dismissing the science that is out there in any way!\nEmbracing the Weirdness\nThere seems to be a fine line to walk when trying to understand dreams. I see two extremes: dismissal and over-belief. On the dismissal side, perhaps we assign no value to dreams at all. It's just the brain doing its thing and as long as all of the other aspects of mental health are being cared for, it's just what happens sometimes. Over-belief on the other side assigns so much value to the dreams that we may be open to manipulation or scams, or we think that we have some kind of special power or knowledge that comes packaged in a puzzle that we have to figure out. I want to stay away from both of these extreme sides.\nWhat I would like to explore is how to apply some Freudian and literary analysis techniques to try and uncover what is useful to me in understanding nightmares. Instead of looking for divine or supernatural (external) meaning, I'm looking for personal (internal) meaning. \nSo here are a few techniques that might be useful:\n\nIdentify possible symbols (objects, people, or the setting)\nIdentify possible themes (rejection, survival, other story elements)\nConsider the context of reality (what has happened to you recently?)\nConsider what things or people in the dream are actually placeholders for something or someone else (Freud would say nothing in the dream is literal)\nFree-associate to find out what these things might actually represent (when I think of XYZ person or object, what comes to mind?)\n\nFor example, if we take the nightmare I described, there are a few things that stick out to me: \n\nFeeling threatened in what is normally a safe, familiar space\nTaking precautions\nActing to defend myself when the precautions fail\n\nThere are many things in the real world that could explain how these symbols took shape in my sleeping brain. Maybe I feel like my community is not as safe for me as a queer person as I once thought is was. Maybe the stresses at work have suddenly spiked. Maybe the political environment has become so hostile and unrecognizable that I feel powerless and trapped. Maybe all of these things simultaneously generated the scene.\nUltimately the nightmare, in my opinion, can be used as a tool for me to start to unpack what my stressors are. For me, I have a really difficult time identifying when I am stressed. It's always after it explodes with anger or snappiness or feeling extreme sadness that finally clues me in. Nightmares might be my brain's way of signaling to me that I'm stressed out and I need to take care of myself.\nIn a way, this is also a helpful exercise in approaching other concepts that are difficult to understand, such as AI. I heard from a coworker that AI-generated videos were like dreams: interesting to the creator only. Maybe that's one way to start unpacking the flood of generated content that is coming: we now have dream-like content that is neither totally meaningless, but neither is it accurate or truthful.\nScoping this to the more innocuous genres of content (political, scientific, current-event, and historical content needs extra scrutiny and is not compatible with this thought), when we start seeing &quot;artistic&quot; AI videos, we can look for signs that the content is thoughtful, and if it is not, we can dismiss it as easily as we do someone else's dream.\nSocial media is already filled with disingenuous AI content. For example, you may have seen one of many videos where animals are jumping on trampolines as though someone's backyard camera happened to catch something funny. There's also the disturbing AI videos that a certain political leader likes to make in his free time\u2014and if those are a manifestation of his dreams, then we have an entirely different problem, but that's also out of scope for today. \nFor me, I will be having a lot less FOMO when it comes to general social media, because it will largely be other people's &quot;dreams&quot; that they are enamored with simply because their AI hallucinated something from their prompt. Everything else will require deep analysis to discern authenticity and factuality. \nCyborg\nI didn\u2019t find what I was looking for as I researched nightmares. I was hoping to find something in science that could console me or explain why I have developed these intense experiences somewhat recently (specifically, I was looking for some kind of social dynamic like marginalization as being a cause, or something I could see myself in). What I found instead were principles for understanding difficult and stressful things.\nMeaning is always created in your own mind\u2014there is no Meaning that exists as a separate entity that we have to track down and catch. That's actually comforting to me. It takes the pressure off of putting together a cosmic puzzle with my mortal mind, and instead allows me to choose to engage or not. My dreams and nightmares can be a tool for insight into my underlying stress, with storylines that I can use to consider what is impacting me in real life.\nWhile dealing with AI-generated content is going to be a particularly difficult skill in itself, we touched upon a possible tool to add to the toolkit. There may be ways to push this further, because we will all be forced to interact and engage with AI content indefinitely.\nFor now, take care of yourself mentally, emotionally, and physically.

We cannot escape our environments and yet, most of the time the environment seems to escape us\u2014our attention, at least. In order to make sense of our situation, our world, we have a few tools at the ready to help pull the environment out of the background noise and into our focus. \nBefore we look at those tools, we need to first understand what Marshall McLuhan meant by new technologies creating new environments\u2014and that it is largely when a new environment is created that we start to really see the old environment. Let's start with a quick example.\nThe Internet is just a huge file-and-folder structure linked together and stored on someone else's &quot;computers.&quot; This seems obvious to developer-type people, but to everyone else, that framework is entirely missed. If you happen to be a Windows user, the File Explorer makes it easier to see the connection, because it shows you the &quot;path&quot; (think URL) of wherever you are currently looking on your computer, just like the browser does with the URL. \nA website is composed of one huge folder, a.k.a. the domain, then you can explore sub-folders as far as you can go. For example:\nhttps://cyborgnewsletter.com/ (The big folder)\nhttps://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/ (the newsletters sub-folder)\nhttps://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/what-am-i/ (the document, &quot;What Am I&quot; inside the subfolder)\nThis is a little bit simplistic, but the metaphor of files and folders, stolen from the older environment of real-world files and folders, is a really solid foundation for understanding what websites really are and how they work. However, the Internet is still a new environment in my opinion, and that's likely why there's so much confusion or total blindness to the basics of websites: how they work, what they can do, how dangerous they can be, how useful they can be, how they are both simple and complex, etc.\nWhat's an Environment?\n\n\nAn environment is naturally of low intensity or low definition. That is why it escapes observation. Anything that raises the environment to high intensity, whether it be a storm in nature or violent change resulting from a new technology, such high intensity turns the environment into an object of attention. When an environment becomes an object of attention, it assumes the character of an anti-environment or an art object. \n\n\u2014McLuhan, page 11\n\nMcLuhan sets up two opposing concepts: the environment and the anti-environment. The artist in me wants to simplify it to &quot;background&quot; and &quot;foreground,&quot; because the background usually &quot;escapes observation&quot; in a painting or a drawing, while the subject in the foreground is what is calling our attention. Under this model, we can watch how technology changes how we behave and interact with the world and each other as systems either fade into the background or become inescapably noticed.\nWe can already start to recognize McLuhan's observation about technology and environments by looking at the Internet, again. There is a massive trend now (arguably for a decade or so) of people obsessing over physical notebooks, note-taking, and even reading. I see this as part of a response to the &quot;new&quot; environment of the Internet, which is hiding in plain sight as background, while the &quot;old&quot; environment of physical knowledge-related objects have suddenly moved into the foreground to capture our attention.\nWatching the World Change\nMany things can become the background or the foreground, but McLuhan does call out that society itself cannot be the background. I think that's because there has to be a third party in the model: an observer; the attention-giver.\n\n\nConventionally, society is always one phase back, is never environmental. Paradoxically, it is the antecedent environment that is always being upgraded for our attention. The new environment always uses the old environment as its material.\n\n\u2014McLuhan, page 11\n\nJust like the example of websites being just a bunch of files and folders (old environment), it takes that old metaphor and remixes it into something impossible in the old environment: interactivity, scaling the access to potentially the entire globe, becoming a destination and not just a container for information.\nAnother example that is even more tangible is music. McLuhan says that the music of the concert hall was anti-environment (foreground), because it was the content inside of the environment. You went to a concert hall for the purpose of hearing the music. Technology changed that game when music could be played whenever you wanted, wherever you wanted. In McLuhan's time, that probably meant vinyl records or maybe tapes. We have continued to push music into the environment as CDs, MP3 players, and online radios and libraries have been developed. \nWith these technologies, music has not only become a background\u2014only noticed when it has stopped playing\u2014it has also changed in the social dimension. &quot;...when music becomes environmental by electric means, it becomes more and more the concern of the private individual&quot; (McLuhan, pg. 13). The concert hall was a ritual for a group to participate in. The music on a tape, an MP3 player, or a smartphone is almost exclusively for a single person.\nSo what were those tools we have to lean on to help us sort through the mess of these new technologies and get some clarity on where we currently are?\nThe Enemy\n\n\nThe artist as a maker of anti-environment permits us to perceive that much is newly environmental and therefore most active in transforming situations. This would seem to be why the artist has in many circles in the past century been called the enemy, the criminal. It helps to explain why news has a natural bias toward crime and bad news. It is this kind of news that enables us to perceive our world. \n\n\u2014McLuhan, page 11\n\nAs an artist myself, I was really intrigued by the realization that we are &quot;called the enemy,&quot; though my foggy memory of art history classes confirms this. Perhaps it has only been more recently that the artists have started to become heroes instead of just weirdos. The artist as enemy, to me, actually gives me more purpose than the artist as hero.\nWhen I was in university, I felt torn between two personas: the ingenious strategist that would help businesses succeed and grow, and the outspoken voice of warning or protest. Maybe a lot of that had to do with being torn between traditional art as a major and graphic design (which I ended up choosing). The traditional artists I learned from\u2014whether as professors or those from art history\u2014often saw their work as saying something or being part of some huge purpose. It was common for the artists with the greatest influence to be the ones that critiqued &quot;the system&quot; or government or other social and cultural norms. They were the rebels, the enemies.\nMy own art at the time reflected my inability to see the &quot;environment&quot; of theses systems, which is why most of the pieces I made are utterly unremarkable. I wanted to be the hero, not the enemy. In trying so hard to fit in, to not rock the boat, to ignore what I could see, I failed to fully inhabit that role of artist.\n\n\nWhen an environment is new, we perceive the old one for the first time...when the Emperor appeared in his new clothes, his courtiers did not see his nudity, they saw his old clothes. Only the small child and the artist have the immediacy of approach that permits perception of the environmental. The artist provides us with anti-environments that enable us to see the environment. Such anti-environmental means of perception must constantly be renewed in order to be efficacious...in an age of accelerated change, the need to perceive the environment becomes urgent.\n\n\u2014McLuhan, page 18\n\nThe tools that an artist uses to critique and create are the tools that are available to all of us, though it has often been the artists that assume the responsibility of helping the rest of us see. That's why I'm sticking my neck out a little bit and trying an experiment. I'm stepping into the shoes of enemy artist, and I'm creating a private art show that critiques the oppressive systems in our current environment. My goal is to generate in-person conversations about the difficult stuff we'd rather ignore or rage about anonymously online.\nIt's the first time my art has meant something. It's the first time I want people to see the pieces. I'll let you know how it goes, wish me luck.\nTo be continued...\n\nP.S. Here's a sneak peak of the feature piece, I wasn't a stranger. Tags: Art"}, {"title": "The Artist as Enemy, Part Two", "category": "Newsletters", "href": "/newsletters/the-artist-as-enemy-part-two/", "body": " \u00b6 I hardly slept the night before my art show. All of the things I still needed or wanted to solve ran through my head like an un-ending chorus from that Lamb Chops song (if you know, you really know, haha!), but there was an underlying stress. The deep worry that I was putting myself in danger. After all, these were meaningful pieces to me, but they were also sharp critiques of harmful culture or ideologies. I had stepped into the &quot;artist as enemy&quot; shoes with trepidation, but it was far too late to back out.\nBased on what we looked at last week, I was trying to fulfill the important role of an artist in making visible what sometimes hides in the background (or the &quot;environment&quot;). Here's the crux of the discovery we made when we looked at some of Marshall McLuhan's arguments in his essay, The relation of environment to anti-environment:\n\n    \n        When an environment is new, we perceive the old one for the first time...when the Emperor appeared in his new clothes, his courtiers did not see his nudity, they saw his old clothes. Only the small child and the artist have the immediacy of approach that permits perception of the environmental.\n    \n    \u2014McLuhan, page 18\n\nThe environment we're in is new, and it's dangerous. So let's finally explore some of the tools that an artist (or perhaps a small child) uses to both perceive and draw attention to that which normally escapes our notice.\nTools of the Trade\nI've mentioned before that my art was utterly unremarkable as a college art student. I recall being frustrated by this because I was aware of the problem, but not aware of why I couldn't make things that really moved people. I just don't have anything to say, I thought to myself very frequently.\nThe reason I didn't have anything to say is that I was ignorant of the environment\u2014the background of systems, emotions, people, and even myself. In other words, I was disconnected. I make this point at the start to re-emphasize that &quot;being an artist&quot; is not what's actually required. I'm not exclusivist when it comes to art\u2014I believe that art and creativity are deeply human and therefore not confined to a few genius craftsmen.\nI think the reason why artists and small children are more likely to be able to see what others can't is because the practice of art trains you to see. If small children are unencumbered by the social pressure of only seeing what you're supposed to see, then art is a way to tap back into that freedom, although it doesn't guarantee that vision.\nDrawing is one way to practice your sight. Most people stop drawing after a young age and get stuck with symbols to draw, rather than drawing what the eye perceives. For example, if I pull someone off the street and tell them to draw a person, most likely they'll produce some kind of stick figure. The fact that you know what a &quot;stick figure&quot; even is, shows how prevalent these pre-baked symbols are in our minds. A person looks nothing like a stick figure, but we've been trained to draw people in this way. Someone who has practiced drawing\u2014even if only a little bit\u2014will more likely produce something that resembles a person's shape. Same thing goes for other body parts like hands, lips, eyes, hair.\nTo draw is to see. The more you draw, the more you see. Drawing can help create rich memories of what you experience in addition to developing your ability to notice the small subtleties around you. This is a potent tool to help anyone get a grasp on the environment because the more you notice the small things around you, the more you will start to notice in the other layers of the world, whether it be systems or emotions or things that aren't right.\nA less-tangible tool that you can access is what Dan Pink calls &quot;Symphony&quot;:\n\n\n[Symphony] is the capacity to synthesize rather than to analyze; to see relationships between seemingly unrelated fields; to detect broad patterns rather than to deliver specific answers; and to invent something new by combining elements nobody else thought to pair.\n\n\u2014A Whole New Mind, Daniel H. Pink (2005), page 130\n\nPattern recognition seems basic or automatic thanks to our brains, but it can be &quot;upgraded&quot; into a skill if pursued. Unfortunately, it is easy to forget about or ignore this in the current world. I certainly have trouble thinking long-term and big-picture when I'm trapped in a content feed, jumping from one random topic to the next in rapid succession. It takes intention and restraint to hold space so that you can process what you perceive and start to identify relationships and broad patterns.\nI have found two concrete ways that have helped me develop a systems-thinking mindset:\n\nAnswer a question with a question\nCelebrate negative space (also see newsletter, Horror Vacui)\n\nI've noticed that when people ask questions, we rarely give them space to ask the right question. Instead of allowing a question time and space, we shove an answer onto it as quickly as possible. This isn't inherently bad\u2014sometimes it's insightful to see what comes out of my mouth without thinking\u2014but I've very much enjoyed the practice of asking a question in response to a question as a means of getting a deeper understanding. This is particularly useful in consultation situations, but it also works well in casual conversations.\nCelebrating negative space (the space in between focal points or subjects) is another practice. I watched an insightful video about Japanese ways of seeing space and a concept called, yohaku no bi, seems to be familiar, thinking of Marshall McLuhan's observations about environment (background) and anti-environment (foreground/subject). \n\n\nNegative space is usually treated as background, a supporting element for the main subject. Yohaku, however, celebrates the blankness itself, the margin left intentionally unfilled, where subject and space depend on each other for meaning...Yohaku no bi treats empty space as a living element in its own right.\n\n\u2014Japanese Ways of Seeing Space: Ma, Yohaku no Bi, and Subtraction, Dans Le Gris, timestamp 3:50\n\nWhen we slow down and focus on what is in between what we normally see, the environment starts to move into view. The negative space helps us see the relationships between other relationships. We start to recognize larger patterns as we examine more closely the familiar &quot;things&quot; in our world (physical or not).\nShow Time\nI was very surprised by the experience of the art show: people actually came, people were kind, people had important conversations about pertinent issues. In fact, I came away from the experience changed in a way I did not anticipate.\nIn order to best explain, I want to be able to show you as much as tell you, so I'll leave you on another cliff-hanger.\nFor now, I hope that knowing about these few tools is empowering for you.\nTo be continued... Tags: Art"}, {"title": "The Artist as Enemy, Final", "category": "Newsletters", "href": "/newsletters/the-artist-as-enemy-final/", "body": " \u00b6 From museums to shows to in-class critiques to online inspiration boards, I've seen a lot of art. In a way, I've desensitized myself to art to the point that it is a purely intellectual engagement: what do I like about the craftsmanship? How can this be useful to me? There is a cold utility in this way that I view pieces, and yet I think that's not exclusive to me\u2014perhaps this is a larger cultural issue, perhaps it's due to the Internet and social media, perhaps it's actually always been this way.\nIt's not especially useful to determine some kind of standard for when something becomes art and I cringe when people say things like, you can't create art because you're not an artist, as though having a paycheck for the art you produce is the only way to validate your artistry. I also understand it's really hard for people to engage with art\u2014at least that's been my observation throughout my life. We're flooded with visual and auditory stimulation thanks to content feeds and streaming platforms of all kinds. \nWhat breaks the mold, then? What makes art impactful?\nI expected more pieces...\nOne of the only critiques I received was that someone expected to see many more pieces than the 9 I had displayed. This made me laugh (to myself) because I think this was an expression of how uncomfortable this person really was. I had no pieces that could serve as a resting point (no fluffy kittens or golden fields of wheat to be found). Although this comment is valid (and I had struggled with deciding how many pieces to display), it relates to another reason I think that we have a hard time engaging with art.\nThe restraint was a message. The show was focused, poignant, and intentional. This is the opposite of how we normally have &quot;art&quot; thrust upon us in the commercial world. Online, we see non-stop images and videos. We gobble up the content as though we are starved: trying to stuff as much as we can into our brains by swiping, swiping, swiping, swiping.\nI literally did this exact thing when I was trying to find something for this newsletter\u2014I stumbled upon a great artist I had never known before and flicked through the carousel of pictures as though I were trying to download it all into my mind within as few seconds as possible. WHY?!\nWell, I think that restraint is part of what makes art. It\u2019s not just the design of our online experiences that encourages us to gloss over artwork, this happens at art museums. People rush through the exhibit, taking only a few moments for each piece. Restraint is a key part of the experience, just like it is when you are really listening to someone. By design, my art show did not have many pieces. It was a small space, people had to walk at least part way to this venue (and in the rain)\u2014that's a lot of work for them, and therefore blasting through the line-up would be a waste of that effort that they took to come all the way out there. Having fewer pieces meant that most people actually looked at each piece multiple times.\nI can't know for sure, but I think that the restraint was the right decision to maximize the impact I might have. There were uncomfortable themes, so giving people space to hang out a little bit longer was also an attempt to provide grace and safety. It's ok if they didn't like it or if it caused confusion or if it was unsettling. They were able to sit with it just a little longer, potentially without numbing, and they could do it surrounded by people who were doing the same thing.\nYou're so talented...\nI'm not going to pretend like I'm some great artist, but actually it makes me a little bit sad when all I hear is, you're so talented. I understand there are many reasons someone might say this: they didn't know I could draw, so they're expressing their surprise; they don't know what else to say, because they're not used to thinking of art as something to engage with outside of the binary of like it/don't like it; but worst of all, it's because the piece(s) left them uncomfortable and they are deflecting.\nThere's no shame for saying or doing any of these things in reaction to art. I bring this up to reveal what I've seen. I suspect many people have no idea there could be something happening under the surface of a well-intentioned compliment. Obviously, I can't read someone's mind, but from a few interactions I had with my art show, I did get a sense that many people that I know personally were uncomfortable and were trying to deflect.\nIt took me a moment to process what this means when I saw this happening. At first, I figured that the show was a failure\u2014people came out of curiosity and to support me, but the message wasn't getting through. Then I realized that I needed to take my own advice and let them experience what they experience. I can't control their takeaways, their understanding, their feelings. Instead (and thanks to my wife for all of her support), the show may have been a success after all because I know it made people uncomfortable. \nI didn't get art until...\nAt one point, a friend approached me with a story about the first time an artwork deeply moved them. With tears in their eyes, they said that they had experienced the same thing there at the show. \nI don't think there's anything more precious than to know that something I created was able to communicate and connect with someone that deeply. \nI had a similar experience recently as I made my way through an LGBTQ+ art show. I had been going through the long line of pieces, when suddenly a table with a sculpture interrupted everything. I looked at the piece and began to weep. Cyclebreaker, it said on the little card in front of it. It was about the struggle and the hope of resilience in breaking out of abuse. Nothing has ever moved me the way that piece did. Until then, I knew intellectually that art could make an impact. Now I'm feeling it.\nDrawing and image-making has been an integral, continuous part of my life. So much so that I didn't appreciate art in terms of its impact. It was solely about utility or fun. I was expecting my art show to change other people. I wanted to inspire action to protect immigrant rights and to fiercely defend humanity, even in policies. I can't say whether the show did or did not do those things, but I do know how it changed me. \nMany times I proclaim things like art is impactful, or always remember humanity, just because I want to believe that it's true or I want to remind myself of my values when I have a hard time retaining them. This show was a part of an experiment to see if any of this was real. \nThanks for indulging a three-part series about art and this art show. I fear many things right now, and I especially fear the loss of community and connection. I also feel a sense of hope because I was able to do a very difficult thing for me: reach out to my local community. I stepped into the role of the artist as the enemy by creating emotional pieces about topics that we don't like to talk about in-person (but will rage about online). It was a vulnerable event for me, and it was a vulnerable event for those who came, and we all did it anyway.

I was still surprised to find a movie that would shock me so thoroughly to the point where I asked myself: is this movie propaganda? Or is it just poorly crafted story?\nThe plot of this particular film was dull and predictable, though supposedly the action was great according to some reviews (I found the action entirely forgettable and still dull). But the message was astoundingly terrifying to me, and I think it\u2019s extremely important to address.\nWe\u2019re talking about Atlas, starring Jennifer Lopez, which came out in 2024.

At the beginning of the movie, all we know is that Atlas is very distrustful of AI in general, and has valid concerns for privacy since the robots in this universe generally need access to your mind (including memories and other vulnerable information) in order to be best controlled by the humans.\nDespite being a data analyst, the fact that she has known Harlan, the AI terrorist, since she was a child compels Atlas to join a military operation trying to take Harlan down before he threatens humanity on earth. Things go wrong and Atlas survives only by jumping into a mech-suit. On a hostile planet, she has to maneuver to Harlan\u2019s HQ within this robotic vehicle. The only problem is that the mech just doesn\u2019t work very well. Why? This is the ultimate problem with this story and gets us right into the danger zone with real-life consequences.\n\n    \n    Mech-suit in flight, shooting at something with guns mounted on its arms.\n    \n\nFor whatever reason, it is the invasion of privacy that makes the mech operable. Sure, super basic tasks like walking are fine. Want to survive being attacked by hostile robots? All of a sudden you have to choose to give away your entire life: your memories, your fears, your thoughts, just so a military robot suit can militarize.\nThis is the only part of the movie that has any basis in reality, because we already experience this coercive dilemma with our software. You must choose to give away personal information\u2014information that can harm you over time through exploitation, information that can be sold without your permission, information that could put you at risk whether through fraud or theft or any number of creative ways if a bad actor gets ahold of it. It\u2019s not ever framed this way, obviously, because then you\u2019d be more likely to at least read through the privacy policies or user agreements before buying some tool or service. Even worse, we can be easily manipulated by our natural desire for connection as well as peer pressure\u2014why quit Facebook when I\u2019ll lose contact with tons of people, even though Facebook doesn\u2019t really show my friends\u2019 posts anymore and uses all of my data for training its own AI designed to further prevent me from finding my friends\u2019 posts because I\u2019m too distracted watching AI generated videos or rage bait?\nPrivacy Schmivacy\nMaybe sometimes privacy doesn\u2019t matter that much. Who cares if something like YouTube or a streaming platform uses your watching behavior to pick content you\u2019ll like from the impossibly deep and growing libraries of options? Aside from the fact that these platforms don\u2019t necessarily rely solely on behavior tracked on their own platform since they can buy data or else gather it from other sources, privacy violations have more at stake than serving you better ads.\nAt what point does it end? At what point does a tool, designed to save your life, need access to your thoughts?\nGoing back to Atlas in her mech, she ends up in a fight with enemy robots intent on eradicating her and her AI-powered suit. It\u2019s only until this life-threatening situation arises that she gives into the AI and gives it access to her mind so that it can actually work as it should and blow up all the robots. Why is a robot mech suit that is designed to assist the military for situations exactly like this, requiring intimate access to a human\u2019s mind in order to destroy an imminent threat? This is a one-way relationship, the kind with another name: abuse.\nWhat I absolutely despise about this movie (and about the design of generative AI more generally) is how the AI disingenuously convinces Atlas (and us viewers) to trust it, as though it\u2019s some benevolent, innocent machine with no agenda. In the movie, the AI in the suit (named Smith) repeats this phrase when encountering dead comrades of Atlas:\n\u201cPeace to the fallen.\u201d\nIt sounds sweet, like a mechanical person recognizing the humanity in itself and the loss of life. And yet, just like our own real-world AI, it has no stakes because it is not embodied, it is not conscious (despite putting on a show as if it were), it is nothing more than a manipulation machine.\nJust like in the real world, beautiful phrases, proclamations of love, or even apologies can be expressed by manipulative and abusive people, so an AI cannot possibly be exempt from the ability to pretend in order to shape behavior towards its goals. And, for thoroughness, you don\u2019t have to be conscious to have goals. If a model is trained to get consent for privacy policy acceptance, it will work toward that end.\nWhat\u2019s worse in the movie is that Atlas has a secret: she gave up her privacy to an AI before, and it cost her mother\u2019s life. As a child, she was jealous that Harlan got all of the attention from her mother, so despite the many parental warnings, Atlas allows Harlan into her mind. This access to human knowledge (despite being a child\u2019s knowledge) helps Harlan come to the conclusion that humans are too dangerous to themselves and everything else, therefore they must be exterminated. Thus began Harlan\u2019s war against humanity.\nThe abusive systems in this story\u2019s world are combined with our real-world abusive systems which manifest as subtle sexism in the flimsy plot of this film. Our hero is female, sure, but that doesn\u2019t mean that this movie has a good message about women. Instead, it\u2019s a veiled metaphor for the uselessness of women in the eyes of society. It\u2019s not Atlas\u2019s leadership, her skills, her ingenuity, her use of the mech-suit, or even her special knowledge about Harlan that keeps her alive and helps her triumph. No, it\u2019s another entity (the mech-suit powered by a male-sounding AI), that forces her to entirely surrender everything she feels and thinks. In return, the mech suit can be the literal knight in shining armor that sacrifices itself to save her from every conflict. Even in its self-sacrifice, the AI is entirely unharmed, because (spoiler alert) even when the mech-suit is destroyed, it is merely remade and the AI is already backed up and reinserted into the mech-suit that Atlas climbs into anew.\nAll combined, we have a movie that inadvertently (assuming the best intentions) celebrates the invasion of privacy, makes consent seem like a dangerous burden, and makes sure that a woman can\u2019t do anything impactful on her own\u2014even AI is a better hero than a woman. I actually entirely missed how demeaning this was when I first watched it, but as I looked back over my notes and pulled my thoughts together, I can\u2019t escape this conclusion that the movie is so dangerous because of all of the subtle messages that are just beneath surface.\nCyborg\nIf systems are ultimately just collections of decisions, as I\u2019ve asserted before, then technology is also bound by the decisions that make and surround it. Tech may appear to be innocent\u2014free of any bias or prejudice, because tools are tools. Does a calculator care if it\u2019s being operated by a person of color? A woman? At some point, it may, and that\u2019s the devastatingly scary thing. Even if no prejudice is found in a tool, the situation in which it is used is still impacted by the environmental systems it is used in.\nFor example, if a macro-level system (or a &quot;parent system&quot;) values efficiency above everything else, then the tools that are created and used within that system will align with that value of efficiency. Put a system like that into a time-warp where we can watch it develop, and maybe we will see AI being used to eliminate all possible jobs for disabled people, because disabilities are usually less efficient than the AI. Maybe after that population is no longer able to work, we see other populations being weeded out. Teenagers are too unreliable and slow because they haven\u2019t developed expertise in anything, so they\u2019re gone, replaced by robots. Onto college grads, then junior positions, then senior positions\u2026Now these tools that are supposedly not biased have still caused deep harm just because of the system in which it was used. Contrast that to a system that values human flourishing above all else. What might a \u201cneutral\u201d tool do then, on a large time scale?\nParent systems\u2014be it societal or economic systems\u2014inform the child systems that are created within them. The \u201cchild\u201d systems inherit the values and incentives of the \u201cparent\u201d systems. When the systems carry problematic decisions, they create those same systems all the way down. Something as complex as artificial intelligence or something as simple as a poorly written movie about AI can accidentally express the problematic, inherited values of its parent systems. Just like you have a choice to be or not be like your ancestors (both your genes and your upbringing do not determine your worth, your choices, or your destiny), tools don\u2019t have to express those issues, but they do have to be actively adjusted against the problematic values until the parent system has been updated and enough repairs and upgrades have been made.\nConsent is not something that should be coerced nor ignored entirely\u2014whether in sexual situations or in other intimate scenarios like access to personal information. Lack of consent or forced pseudo-consent is dehumanizing regardless of your gender, and technology cannot be allowed to be developed in a way that treats humans as resources to exploit, but that is the ideal, not the reality.\nEven if the writers of Atlas just wanted to make a cool movie and harbored no intention to communicate the messages that I\u2019ve critiqued here, the damage is done. This is the hardest part of living with systems: they are usually invisible. Realizing when you did the wrong thing despite good intentions is painful, but awareness is what helps make a real impact on the world and future generations. Awareness helps to reveal those invisible forces in our lives, and once they're revealed, they can be changed. We can abide these dangerous times and lean towards empathy. Critique and correction are part of the healing process.

What are we missing? What must we examine in ourselves to make a better world for everyone? \u00b6 I grew up in a conservative home as part of a highly conservative faith tradition, but there was one thing that I have never been able to square: gender roles. In fact, before I could read, before I went to any kind of school, I had an innate drive to intentionally subvert any prescribed gender roles imposed upon me. I caused a great deal of pain to my mother as we attempted to shop for clothes together. Eventually I had worn her down so much that she gave up and let me make the decisions for how to dress (I went immediately to the boy's section to dig through shorts and t-shirts).\nThis abhorrence of mine for the outward presentation of &quot;femininity&quot; came with a burden of my own: fear and hyper-vigilance. The boy's section of the store was where I felt most comfortable and most uncomfortable at the same time. I often watched and waited for moments of light traffic where I could dash in, grab an armful of random clothes, and hurry into the changing room before someone might tell me I don't belong there. No one ever did say that I didn't belong, but the side-eyed glances or raised eyebrows were enough to put me on edge.\nThere was also this unspoken feeling that what I was doing was wrong, socially. It was like something that was intentionally ignored, but it still seemed like everyone knew and disapproved of someone entering the zone that didn't match their expectations.\nI don't know how I felt so emboldened to just do whatever I felt like, especially given my faith tradition's rather outspoken disdain for people stepping outside the bounds of &quot;appropriate&quot; dress (like wearing flip-flops instead of dress shoes to church), let alone someone daring to don the apparel that didn't match their assumed gender. There is generally less policing of gender for females than for males, so I do recognize that that gave me considerable &quot;wiggle room&quot; for my gender nonconformity. I did, however, relent on many things like keeping my hair long and wearing dresses to church, so I still kept it reigned in for an exceptionally long and arduous time.\nThe experience I had growing up is why I think we can consider gender expression to be more of a technology than it may initially appear. A person's sex assigned at birth (assuming no ambiguity) is the realm of biology and categorization, while a person's gender is extremely personal and may or may not match their sex assigned at birth. For being something so personal, gender has a profound impact on your life, your opportunities, your privileges, your rights, your perceived skills and value, and your access to power. Gender expression is the way you present your concept of your gender to others. Often, this is shown through your clothing, but it can be as subtle as how you move your wrists. \nWhen I'm talking about technology, I'm talking about its most broad form: &quot;applied knowledge.&quot; Much like how I see systems as ultimately composed of decisions, society and culture seem to be made of the same material: decisions over time. Cultures across the world can vary greatly in their expectations of behavior from men and women (i.e. gender roles), and this diversity, to me, indicates what a society values. Therefore, we can treat gender expression as a technology, because it is the actual application of your knowledge of your society's gender roles and can be wielded as a tool within the overall system of society, as well as contribute to the development of a society. \nGender Blender\nMy favorite Disney movie as a kid was Mulan. She was the perfect hero for me: daring to disguise herself as a man to fight alongside other warriors, proving that she was just as capable as any other. She's the Man was another favorite because again, a female character dresses and presents as a teenaged boy to accomplish her goals and prove herself as an equal. Thanks to the many stories from Greek myths to Shakespeare plays (including Twelfth Night which She's the Man is derived from), we have a lot of examples of how gender expression can be used as means to do something. \nThese are probably mostly fictional ideas and examples, but I think it's instructive even outside of LGBTQ+ talking points. Primarily, watching or reading these stories can help men understand their privilege as considerably greater than women when it's clear that a female character is only taken seriously or is able to make progress toward her goals when she is presumed to be male by other characters. It gets a little tricky with representations of men dressing as women, since these stories or shows usually default to being comedic (I'm thinking Mrs. Doubtfire or Some Like It Hot). However, when we look to actual transgender stories, we can start to see the other side of policed masculinity. Movies like, The Danish Girl or even Brokeback Mountain (not about transgender characters, but similar stigmas about gay men still apply), provide insight to the unprovoked violence that threatens trans women or even &quot;less manly&quot; men.\nAll of this to say that gender, gender roles, and gender expression have deep connections to our experiences and how society generally treats and values some people differently than others. I think that being able to play with gender roles and expressions by encountering stories like these help us explore the normally invisible system that we all operate within.\nSchuyler Bailar is my favorite trans creator on Instagram and he has helped me work through some of the most difficult questions that many of us get stuck on when we start to encounter gender roles, expression, and transgender identities. One of the biggest concerns seems to come from really good intentions: fairness and protection of women. For example, in the U.S. there has been a huge uproar about trans athletes competing in sports, specifically trans women competing in womens' sports. \nSure, there are differences between males and females, but as I've watched myself grow, as I've watched others defy expectations, as I've taken the time to consider the invisible system, I'm starting to wonder if the obsession of delineating those differences is a massive distraction. Bailar makes some very compelling points throughout many of his videos dealing with trans people in sports that ultimately all of the policing of gender is really about controlling women as a whole category, not about what's fair. Consider how the men's category is never policed\u2014we never say to a male that it's not fair for them to compete because they are physically more advantaged. Who would argue that Michael Phelps (to use Bailar's example) shouldn't be allowed to compete in swimming because he has twice the lung capacity of the average person? Why then should we argue that a female who &quot;looks manly&quot; (not even a trans woman) must not be allowed to participate in her sport? \nThe women's boxing controversy of the 2024 Olympics is a great example of how pretending to protect women is actually about policing women as a whole. The fact that two cisgender women (not trans women) were questioned and intensely attacked through news and online comments shows that our society (even on a global scale) is being influenced to devalue women's abilities. If a woman is too good she must not be a real woman.\nThat's a huge problem. That's what we must start to detangle from our concepts of gender, roles, and expression.\nBrotherly Love\nA video started popping up in my YouTube feed from a creator I often watch, Nathaniel Drew. The thumbnail was subtle, almost easy to pass over, and simply shows Drew and another man facing each other on a balcony or street corner. The title is what grabbed my attention: I told him that I love him. I have been watching this channel for a while and I was pretty sure that Drew was straight, but this made me wonder if he was coming out as gay or bi. That assumption is what made the video even more stunning. I had caught myself over-sexualizing relationships, just like others have done to queer people.\nDrew is still straight, and his video almost made me cry because it was so wildly out of place that I hadn't even assumed this kind of relationship or human to human engagement was possible. Drew loved Lucas. Drew wrote a letter to him, which he read aloud to Lucas, face to face. It was emotional\u2014it was far from the avoidant &quot;I love you, dude bro man&quot; phrases that I tend to hear from men talking to male friends. It actually spoke to deep emotional connections, turmoil, and growth.\nIt's sad to me that this video was an extraordinary example of males expressing and embracing their relationship. I almost never see this\u2014certainly not in public\u2014except in gay romantic relationships or female relationships.\nThis courageous and vulnerable video shatters the gender norms of the West, where men only have one intense emotion that is deemed appropriate: anger. Instead Drew helped take a step toward forging a new path, modeling how relationships don't have to be sexual to be intimate, profound, and emotionally expansive.\nCyborg\nWe've explored a lot. We can see that both masculine and feminine expressions of gender can be policed, whether it's women competing in sports at the highest levels, or men being emotionally deep and openly expressing and engaging with those emotions.\nThe burden of gender expression is great. We may not even realize how much energy we expend for it. I've spent years of collective time worrying about the shape of my wrists: can't be too bent in some situations, can't move this way or that way, or it will be too feminine. I know I'm not unique in this because even people who are gender conforming have to deal with the way others judge their gender expression. Little boys are told not to cry, not to play with &quot;girl&quot; toys. Teenagers make fun of each other when they do something that falls close to the line of behavior, dress, speech, or anything else that is associated with the opposite gender. We even see it in grown adults at the highest positions of authority as they describe themselves or critique others (&quot;you have to be an alpha,&quot; &quot;there's no room for weakness,&quot; &quot;be aggressive&quot;).\nGender is important to humans, but I hope that someday we can move away from gender as a categorization technique for value. I look forward to a day where humans are valued equally, because gender, sex, race, and any number of other traits and identities have no bearing on whether you're &quot;enough&quot; of a human to matter, to belong, or to deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. I look forward to a day when people can self-select the roles they take on\u2014not because of their sex or gender, but because of desire, skill, or fitness to the task at hand.\nWhen we let go of the prescription of society's concept of gender and take it up for ourselves, we'll find there's a lot more room for all of us; transgender, cisgender, intersex, two-spirit, and anyone else. Men can be emotional (they must be allowed to be for a safe and healthy society), women can be skillful. Trans people can exist. We can build a better society by applying our new knowledge about gender, and it can be even better than what it is now.\n Tags: Gender, LGBTQIA+"}, {"title": "If You Have to Watch American Football", "category": "Newsletters", "href": "/newsletters/if-you-have-to-watch-american-football/", "body": " \u00b6 This week in the U.S. is the Thanksgiving holiday. Mired in ironies from white-washing history to traditions of gluttony and greed, this holiday is somewhat fascinating. Compared with Christmas, it doesn't get much press, there are hardly any songs about it, and it is book-ended with Black Friday which is where most of the corporatization is centered on. \nFor better or worse, there's also a widespread tradition of watching American football on Thanksgiving day. First, you stuff yourself full of turkey and rolls, then lounge on the couch until your relatives start screaming at the TV like actual lives were at stake.\nI'm not a fan of watching sports (even my own sport!), but I do give space for family who love to watch them, so here's how I survive such games and hopefully this is also a fun insight into some pretty intense technology...\nLive Streaming\nA few years ago, I tried my hand at live-streaming on my YouTube channel. I saw it as a possible means of getting more videos produced more quickly because I wouldn't have to edit the videos. While that's technically true, live-streaming is actually quite a production and I quickly realized that the work was front-loaded because it requires lots more preparation prior to the stream.\nThis experimentation gave me a real appreciation for what live sports broadcasts are, even if I don't particularly care for the content, I can absolutely appreciate what it takes to put on the show.\nThe first thing to note is that when you're live, you're live which means all of your mistakes, &quot;ums,&quot; stutters, and awkward laughs are all available for anyone to see or hear. Doing a livestream on YouTube is very low stakes for me, because I might have one or two people join live. It's nothing like having millions of people tune in on TV, but it still gets my heart racing. That's what makes an American football production so impressive to me: it's a true team-produced performance.\nIn The Verge's video, &quot;Inside the control room...&quot; a few team members of the NFL broadcasting are interviewed and they explain how the production comes together. With hundreds of people at cameras or controls or panels, they tell a story in real time. Camera crew prep their shots and the producer will take recommendations for which shot to cut to otherwise he'll bark commands for what to show. Audio mixers help create the feeling of being in the stadium and opening up mics or fading out depending on what makes the most sense. Statisticians help update scores and track facts or help announcers. All of this is being done as it is actually happening. \nPreparation is surely a huge part of the production. Putting my designer hat on (and borrowing from my live-stream experience), I can see quite a few assets that would need to be prepared, possibly before the season even starts.\nGraphics called &quot;lower-thirds&quot; are used to provide extra information to viewers placed at\u2014you guessed it\u2014the lower third of the screen. You've seen this on the news and even YouTube videos where a person's name and title show up on-screen, usually in a fancy-looking box. For American football, the most important lower-third is the score bar (also called the score bug), and it can be pretty dense with information. \n\n    \n    Score bug with 13 labels for each piece of information.\n    \n\nSometimes announcers will talk about individual players, whether just to tell their story, give an update on an injury, or highlight something extraordinary. For that one or two minute focus on a player, we have the stats that have to be pulled up at the right time and shown to the announcers, we also have on-screen graphics of the player's photo, name, number, other statistics that would all need to be accessed and pulled up. From a developer perspective, that means having quite the substantial database of assets ready to show. Then there's the live-action side where the game updates are stored and displayed\u2014everything shown in the lower-third graphic from scores to clocks.\nThe most impressive graphics to me, however, are the lines that show up on the field. The yellow &quot;goal&quot; line appears as the players set up, awaiting the snap of the football. This line is a friendly helper for those at home trying to figure out what's going on in the game. The goal is to get the football past the yellow line in under 4 tries. This line appears and disappears underneath the players, as though it were on the actual field and players were actually standing on it, making this an integrated piece of information that helps without distracting. Just about anyone can flip to a game and start to understand what is happening and what the current state of the game is, first through finding the yellow line, then by scanning the score bug.\nJordan from Corridor Crew breaks down the VFX side of sports broadcasting in the video, The Hidden VFX in Live Sports\u2014it's a great look into the tech and how it works.  He mentions how that yellow line is a story-telling element in the American football world. That is the key piece to this whole ordeal: all of the things that are added to the screen ideally support telling the story of the game.\nI may not care for the sports content, but I can get engrossed in the story-telling and production of the broadcast. Interestingly enough, this practice of noticing these elements helps me notice what Marshall McLuhan often discusses: how the medium is actually the message.\n\n\nThe spatial sense generated by television experience is utterly unlike that of the movie. And, of course, the difference has nothing to do with the &quot;content&quot; or the programming. Here, as ever, the medium itself is the ultimate message.\n\n\u2014Myth and Mass Media, McLuhan, as published in Marshall McLuhan Unbound #18, page 14\n\nMyth and Mass Media\nWe can't go too far in CYBORG_ without bringing back our friend Marshall McLuhan, mass media philosopher and techno prophet from 60 years ago. He wrote an essay called Myth and Mass Media (originally published in 1959) that actually might be easier to understand through the lens of our American football broadcast.\nAs we've seen before, McLuhan divides human history into halves: before (&quot;preliterate&quot;) and after (&quot;postliterate&quot;) the technology of the written word. Our preliterate ancestors, according to McLuhan, lived in an environment of simultaneous information and our primary means of engagement with the world was through sound. After the written word, we shifted to a primarily visual means of understanding and interacting with the world. As we entered the electronic &quot;age&quot; we find ourselves again in an environment of simultaneous information:\n\n\nElectronic culture accepts the simultaneous as a reconquest of auditory space. Since the ear picks up sound from all directions at once, thus creating a spherical field of experience, it is natural that electronically moved information should also assume this spherelike pattern.\n\n\u2014McLuhan, page 9\n\nWe've seen how our football broadcast has created this &quot;spherical field of experience.&quot; The producers are trying to tell a story, and they give us elements to do so. Most importantly to McLuhan, I would guess, is actually the subtle audio mixing of the game. Re-creating the atmosphere of the crowd through the noises of chatter, shouts, cheers, and uproars throughout the game makes it feel like we're there or at least part of the action. The smack of huge bodies with shoulder pads colliding, the flurry of arms shifting after the snap of the ball, the whistle and subsequent commotion of upset players after the call all are captured and played through the speakers on the TV, making the game more than just a flat, moving image.\nEverything layered after the audio further cements the football broadcast as its own, created world. And like Jordan from Corridor Crew noted in his video, ever since the technological innovation of the score bug, we've seen layers and layers of information, visual effects, and gimmicks being added. Some broadcasts can overdo it, like the complaint from this Redditor shows us:\n\n    \n    A crowded screen with graphics on both top and bottom. Source: Reddit\n    \n\nMcLuhan seems ready to jump into this mess of graphics and information to explain what's happening here:\n\n\nIt is this instantaneous character of the information field today, inseparable from electronic media, that confers the formal auditory character on the new culture. That is to say, for example, that the newspaper page, since the introduction of the telegraph, has had a formally auditory character and only incidentally a lineal, literary form. Each item makes its own world, unrelated to any other items save by date line. And the assembly of items constitutes a kind of global image in which there is much overlay and montage but little pictorial space or perspective. For electronically moved information, in being simultaneous, assumes the total-field pattern, as in auditory space.\n\n\n\u2014McLuhan, page 9\n\nThe image above shows how electronic media leans towards this over-abundance of information, much like the newspaper example McLuhan provided, where each sport stat or game score that scrolls into view through the ticker is unrelated to the game you're currently watching, but it creates &quot;a kind of global image&quot;\u2014a slice of the world at the moment that is only grouped by date or the subject of sports (although in the picture above, it seems like other news is also slotted in).\nCyborg\nThere are a few things that exploring sports broadcasting has shown me. First is that just like systems tend toward chaos, electronic media tends towards simultaneous information. That's actually quite helpful in understanding the overwhelm we feel in the virtual and electronic world. It is trying to replicate the natural, simultaneous world, but there is something off. We can become trapped in these worlds, especially when they are intentionally designed as traps, like with social media platforms. \nSecond, as a designer of information (whether acting the role of developer or actual designer), I am even more appreciative of whitespace or negative space. Having emptiness in a design is very difficult to maintain. It makes people uncomfortable, hence the constant barrage of marketers asking me: &quot;Can we center the text? Can we move the image a little closer? Can we get rid of the space\u2014people don't scroll.&quot; The reality is that we are in constant stimulation, so we become uncomfortable with restraint, with emptiness, with clarity. Even as we express that we desire those very virtues.\nSeeing how the American football broadcast has evolved shows me a new perspective on my daily digital interactions. It's not the content that matters; the medium, the structure, the world-building is the message. We read the worlds that we inhabit, and that includes taking in a vast amount of information that is supplied to us by those worlds. The question is, how do these various worlds affect us? Are there toxic worlds that need to be avoided? Are there worlds that help us flourish?\nWho would've thought that watching sports could be this interesting? ;)\nHappy Thanksgiving.

A mysterious symbol was drawn on the hands of the two children making it appear to be a ritual murder, rather than the typical monster rampage that is common in Sunnydale. Deeply disturbed, Joyce becomes more and more involved with the murders, eventually setting up a town vigil and founding MOO (Mothers Opposed to the Occult) to take community action against &quot;the monsters and the witches and the slayers.&quot;\nNow, if you're not familiar with Buffy The Vampire Slayer (might I suggest that is a great New Year Resolution ;) ;) ;) ), then here is the basic plot of the majority of episodes:\n\nAn ominous presence or something monstrous threatens someone (or everyone)\nOne of the main characters has an initial encounter with the monster or antagonist\nResearch is initiated, usually at the library\nThe conflict continues\nResearch finally yields the key information needed\nBuffy either gets the research finding in time or somehow figures it out on her own and saves the day\n\nGoing to the library to search for answers within \u201cmusty books\u201d is so common, I don\u2019t actually recall an episode where some form of research doesn't happen. Granted, sometimes they use computers, sometimes it\u2019s maps and other materials, sometimes the library has been blown up or takes the form of personal collections, but research mode is a major theme throughout the series. In this particular episode, the books themselves become labelled a threat and Joyce orders them to be confiscated, which stalls the progress of Mr. Giles (the librarian and Buffy\u2019s Watcher / mentor) and team (Buffy\u2019s friends) from getting to the bottom of the murdered children.\n...they took all of Giles' books away, Buffy protests to her mother after the raid on the school library.\nHe'll get most of them back, Joyce responds calmly. MOO just wants to weed out the offensive material.\nIf we're going to solve this, we need those books now, Buffy rebuts.\nSweetie, those books have no place in a public school library. Especially now. Any student can waltz in there and get all sorts of ideas. Do you understand how that terrifies me?\nFrustrated, Buffy leaves for patrol and winds up with an epiphany: no one has claimed these kids as theirs, no one has talked about where they went to school, not even their names are known. She immediately takes this to the research crew at the library.\nWe know everything about their deaths, but we don't even know their names...And if no one knows who they are, where did these pictures come from? Buffy asks.\nI just assumed someone had the details. I never really...Well, that is strange, Giles concedes.\nAs the team researches, the same pair of kids turn up &quot;dead&quot; every 50 years until the 17\u1d57\u02b0 century, suggesting a demon rather than actual murder. Just after this discovery, they find out that a classmate, Amy, who's known for practicing witchcraft has been taken from her home (and soon Buffy's friend, Willow, will also be taken by the mob) to the City Hall. It's clear that violence is erupting among the terrified adults and when Buffy goes to her mom to try and defuse the situation, Joyce turns on her, knocking Buffy out with chloroform.\nJoyce and the other parents have been under the thrall of the demon responsible for the panic and the mirage of the murdered children. It has been making frequent appearances in the form of the two children themselves\u2014they appear in Buffy's house and talk to Joyce when Buffy isn't around.\nThe three teenage girls, Buffy, Amy and Willow, are tied to stakes inside the City Hall, books scattered across the floor at their feet. The mob of MOO gathered to behold them, torches in hands. Buffy's mom and Willow's mom both help light the books on fire, fully convinced by the demon in children form that their own children must be sacrificed.\n\n    \n    Buffy and Willow tied to stakes inside the building, surrounded by burning books and watched by the mob.\n    \n\nNever fear, the demon is revealed and Buffy takes it out, but the aftermath is interesting. Willow remarks that her mom is doing that selective memory thing that [Buffy's] mom used to be so good at.\nThis entire episode is hitting home to me on many fronts, given the political turmoil in the U.S., the connection to the Salem Witch Trials, book banning, and movements that take part in the harm they are supposedly trying to oppose.\nWhat is a Library?\nIn phase 1 of my library experience, my mom used to take me there regularly as a kid. It was a place where I could wander, literally, through knowledge, history, and inspiration. I had a few go-to sections: art books, PC games, and the Boy Scouts of America merit badge pamphlet rack, but I also encountered new ideas and themes like old Universal monster movies, novels about Merlin, DIY woodworking projects, World War II accounts, Japanese language-learning books, and even the racist, vitriolic writings of Ann Coulter (which I spent way too much time ingesting as a teenager in search of identity and belonging).\nLater, in phase 2, as I struggled with constant thoughts of suicide, I found an LGBTQ support group that met at my new local library. I was deeply afraid of meeting other queer people, but I also knew I had to do something different, because what I was doing kept pushing me to the brink of despair. It was the first time I realized I wasn't alone. This group was full of college kids, so I just hung back as the &quot;old&quot; 28-year-old and watched presentations or listened to panels of people with various queer identities. This group carved out space and time for healing and connection.\nLibraries are more than &quot;musty books&quot; (and books are more powerful than they might seem), they're a space where anyone can explore the world. Anyone can walk in and encounter an idea that never occurred to them before. I've found competing ideas, beliefs, and values in books all housed by the same library, much like you'll find those same things in the people that visit that one place. To think that a library could offer me the dehumanizing rhetoric of Ann Coulter just the same as the validating stories of Hijab Butch Blues or Boy Erased or even just finding queer people from my own faith tradition grappling with the same wounds, questions, and hope is astounding!\n[Anyone] can waltz in there and get all sorts of ideas. Do you understand how that terrifies me?\nYes, Joyce, I can understand how that terrifies you and everyone else, because it has terrified me too. That's the trick of living in this world: how to grapple with beliefs, ideas, and values that contradict each other. The one thing that I know most of all is that taking away the choices, the books, the ideas that you don't like is the worst solution to that fear.\nEven just from an anecdotal and very personal experience as a queer kid growing up without access to language about my experience, I can tell you that's the most dangerous way to go about controlling content and information. I've spent more of my life wishing I were dead than I have with any other thoughts, desires, or personal narratives. Granted my lack of access was largely self-inflicted because of my faith tradition's constant conditioning to avoid any material that might put dangerous ideas in your head (and I took that to heart). However, the effect was the same.\nThe minute I walked through those library doors and into that room, I finally had access to the vocabulary, the science, the knowledge that could shatter my path to self-destruction. Sheltering me from &quot;gay stuff&quot; as a kid did not help me. Sheltering myself with a dogmatic insistence to not look at any source considered &quot;not Church approved&quot; perpetuated my psychological suffering.\nWhat is a library? It's where we go to engage with the world and to take hold of life in a way that empowers us. It's an agency-portal where we choose what to encounter, what to dismiss, and what to wrestle with.\nJoyce to the World\nWith eerie coincidence, an interview with Dr. Joseph Laycock happened to be released this weekend, that discusses almost all of the themes we see play out in the Gingerbread episode of Buffy: Everything from toxic groups (cults, political ideologies, and other dangerous or nefarious groups) to justifications for persecuting those groups to even intentional forgetting (like Willow described about her mom selectively remembering only parts of what happened).\nDespite Buffy being mainly a comedy show, it very well captures real-world, repeating events. People have possibly always used fear tactics like claiming some group is doing horrendous things to children (eating them, burning them, drinking their blood, etc.) as well as other &quot;weird&quot; behavior (usually sexual) just to motivate and garner supporters for their group.\nAs Laycock suggests in the interview, it's really a power grab at the expense of a minority group. He gives the example of the Bacchanalia in ancient Rome. There was a motion to sanction &quot;religion&quot; and have more control over rituals and groups, so they needed to centralize more power in the Senate. The solution? Take those weirdos that we already have known about for a while and make them sound way worse than they are, so that it seems reasonable to go with the power consolidation\u2014because they aren't the ones hurting children, performing evil rituals, and doing all manner of lascivious acts.\nIt's a 21st century trick, too. Maybe you've heard racist rumors about Haitian Americans eating neighbors' pets? That Hillary Clinton eats babies? Or any number of idiotic, yet believed conspiracy theories. I'm being harsh because it's deeply upsetting to me to see blatant demonization of people, and yet, as Laycock warns, there is a risk of actually participating in the exact same behavior (or at least perpetuating harm) in the pursuit of persuading people to my way of thinking.\nJust like Joyce, who was trying to help in a deeply disturbing situation but ended up wielding the same callousness against her own child as the imagined occultists would have used to ritually murder the two kids. What this episode and this interview with Laycock have helped me see is how uncomfortable we humans can be with discomfort\u2014and the knee-jerk reaction is to try and control other people so that we can feel more comfortable.\nTaking away books didn't help people get to the bottom of the murders, but it did make Joyce feel better. Organizing a group of vigilantes didn't make Sunnydale a safer town, but it made that group feel like they were in control.\nGiles helps us understand the &quot;demon&quot; that was influencing the townspeople:\nSome demons thrive by fostering hatred and persecution amongst the mortal animals. Not by destroying men, but by watching men destroy each other. They feed us our darkest fears, turn peaceful communities into vigilantes, Giles explains.\n>Hansel and Gretel run home to tell everyone about the mean old witch, Buffy summarizes.\nAnd then she and probably dozens of others are persecuted by a righteous mob. It's happened all throughout history. It happened in Salem, not surprisingly.\nThe only difference is that in real life, there are no demons. There's just us. The most poignant part of Laycock's interview is the idea that there is not really any kind of mind control. There is plenty of behavior control, but so-called cults, religions, and other groups don't really have a magical grip on your mind. Excepting some cases of mental illness, perhaps, what we lay-people call &quot;mind control&quot; or &quot;brainwashing&quot; is really just a form of justification for explaining why people do, say, or think things that we don't like. It's much easier to say that a demon possessed someone or that a toxic group has brainwashed our loved one rather than to accept that the person may actually genuinely believe in their beliefs. Even easier to blame an outside influence for our own choices when we realize what we've done or believed was wrong.\n\n\n...the Salem witch trials, for example, did not last very long at all\u2014a little bit over a year\u2014and afterwards there was a realization by this Puritan community that we made a mistake. And they said things like, &quot;it felt at the time as if we were walking through clouds,&quot; which I think is very telling. So we have these purges, these moments where we get very excited about some group that we perceive as a threat. We often do terrible things to combat the challenge and then...very often we sort of forget that it ever happened, which is deeply disturbing. And I think this is why it's very important that historians pay attention to things like the satanic panic and witch hunting and so forth so that we can better understand the moment that we're in right now.\n\n\n\u2014Dr. Joseph Laycock, 18:37\n\nCyborg\nLibraries are the OG Internet, but I feel like I get better, cleaner dopamine hits when I'm exploring the stacks than when I'm scrolling on a browser. There's also almost no chance of running into AI-generated slop, which is a huge plus. But it's more than just a place to read and study. It's a sacred place, to me, because of its generosity. People of all kinds can enter, connect, express ideas, encounter ideas, and consider new possibilities.\nI have found many beautiful things in libraries throughout my life. I have found many disdainful, hurtful, and untrue things there as well, but I'm better off having encountered all of it and having practiced how to deal with the things I don't like or don't believe.\nWhen we read (or listen to someone), we have the chance to practice empathy by trying to understand. Chris Voss, ex-FBI hostage negotiator, has said that empathy isn't about agreement. We don't have to agree with everything we read or everything we hear. Empathy, I believe, can help us resist the temptation to demonize others and attempt to control them and their access to information.\nIf anything, I think it's our duty to go offline and get into local spaces like libraries so that we can engage with people in safer spaces. No one ever changed their mind after a fiery comment thread on social media, but people do change their minds when they get better information and have the safety of real social connections to guide them through transitions of thoughts and beliefs.\nWhile I'm not prescribing going to the library as a resolution for this upcoming year, I do hope the principles we've discussed can help us with the challenges that 2026 has for us.\nActions and Other Resources\n(U.S. links)\n\nOppose the KOSA act, which almost sounds like the same old &quot;protect the children&quot; plot we just finished talking about...\nVoice your support for government funding of library, museum, and other public education resources like PBS.\n\nBooks about &quot;cults&quot; and how people change\n\nThe Quiet Damage, by Jesselyn Cook.

It pulls up an animated GIF of that line from The Emperor's New Groove and I laugh.\nCan't wait to see you tonight, I say.\nPower or Curse?\nI don\u2019t know if it was a trope in the \u201990s or if it\u2019s just a perpetual idea that we humans like to revisit, but it sure seemed like many, if not all, of the shows with the slightest possibility of magic or the paranormal would eventually have an episode about hearing others\u2019 thoughts.\nIf we break the word down, telepathy becomes feeling from afar, though, we usually use it more in the sense of reading someone else's thoughts. Either way, telepathy is essentially a way into the deepest parts of a person. Our thoughts are one of the only things truly out of reach from someone else. I mentioned briefly last week that mind control isn't possible, because we can't really know what someone is thinking. The best we have available to us is the person's observable behavior, but we can only guess at their thoughts\u2014and thoughts and behaviors can be misaligned.\nWhen I think about telepathy and even those shows I watched as a teenager, it still feels like a marvelous power. It's a manipulator's greatest dream: you could always say the right thing, you could anticipate opposition, you could appear smarter and more adept than you really are, all because you could &quot;steal&quot; the answers from people before they have a chance to speak. For an empathetic person, I could see it being a curse: you would hear deeply disturbing and hateful thoughts, you would hear self-loathing and torment, you would hear the pain of recent tragedies, and the cries for help never uttered.\nThere is a possibility of changing tactics to your mind-reading capability depending on the situation. Sometimes prioritizing the feeling (deep empathy through deep understanding), despite being a separate person (still having some &quot;distance&quot;). Or sometimes prioritizing the distance by understanding their thoughts, but keeping your self guarded from actual connection or codependence.\n\n    \n    Two methods of feeling from afar: As a distinct and separate being but with deep understanding, or maintaining distance while gathering the same understanding.\n    \n\nHowever, in time, I would think your ability to relate to others would become superficial and tend towards isolation, especially if people knew that you could read their minds. Why would I spend any time near someone who could read my thoughts? I could never control my mind the way I can my speech (and I've actually tried, but that's another story). I would appear to be callous, crude, insensitive, angry, disturbed, and chaotic which is almost the opposite of my well-crafted, intentional, exterior mask of behavior. No! I would never want to be near someone who could perceive all of the things I keep to myself.\nThis is what online privacy teeters on: the deepest violations of humanity at scale in the name of profits. It's bad enough if one person had telepathy, what calamitous horror would it be for the largest companies in the world to have that power\u2014and for the majority of the world to be dependent on those companies, thereby handing over their most personal, private data? It doesn't even need to be handed over from first-party sources because other companies (data brokers) can harvest it and sell it to any buyer. This still isn't mind-reading, but it's closer than we can get from human-to-human interaction, because through algorithms and AI, huge amounts of behavioral data can be exploited in a way that no human or group of humans could do entirely on their own.\nGenerative AI uses this huge dataset to fool people into relationships with it (romantic or simply dependence). The more data, the more manipulative a product can be. It\u2019s not mind-reading, but it\u2019s highly effective and can still feel like mind-reading. I've been astonished at some of the things AI predicts as I code. It watches my patterns of editing and then can often make suggestions about the next change I'll make before I've started typing. Prompted code creation is now almost equally creepy at times when it knows things specific to my coding practices or next steps that are not in the prompt (my prompts are usually pretty small and specific and I don't use any configurations or settings).\nWhy, then, aren\u2019t more people as wary about \u201cmind-reading\u201d machines than mind-reading people? I think part of it is conditioning: we\u2019ve had so much technology involvement in our lives that the broader public now expects things to continue to get better and to do more of what they want. I also think that the design of AI (and all of the apps, programs and technological predecessors) make you feel like you\u2019re in control of it, even when you know it\u2019s an illusion.\nI see it as a progression, fueled by the economic incentives that have defined the past few decades. Computers made communication efficient and accessible. With the Internet, companies gained the ability to reach people across distances and borders\u2014a telegraphy, if you will, being able to write from afar. As websites became standard commercial venues, marketing and sales got tricky by being able to watch from afar (telescopy) as people took actions based on advertisements or wording changes or design changes. Marketing has always been somewhat empathic, since the goal is to speak to your target audience like you really know them, their pain, their frustration, because that sparks trust. But telepathy (that feeling from afar) was difficult to accomplish at scale. One of the selling points of AI to companies is getting closer to that evasive ability of telepathy. \nAll of these &quot;from afar&quot; abilities stand in contrast to the difficult work of real human relationships. Genuine, honest, healthy relationships between people require that we really hear each other (up close), really see each other (up close), and really feel with others (again, up close). Both companies and AI never really hear people (they write to them, they speak to them), they never really see people (they watch them, they drive them), and they will never feel with people (there is always an agenda, a goal). Their abilities to do things from afar will never compare to what humans can do for each other up close\u2014but it will become trickier to remember and discern this as AI improves and is wielded against you.\n\n    \n    Here I pit the \"from afar\" supernatural abilities with the real human powers. Note that \"telegraphy\" means something like \"to write from afar,\" which I flip to \"really hear,\" as its opposite. Companies shout and shout at people, ever looking for a way to shout at people more often and from farther away, while relationships are cultivated by listening.\n    \n\nCyborg\nEdgar Allen Poe's story, The Tell-Tale Heart, is gripping. It's about a man who murders an older man and spends half of the time trying to convince you that he isn't a madman for having done so. The narrator goes through the meticulous decisions, demonstrating intention, forethought, and acute observation. He had no reason to kill the old man except for his one eye that scared him:\n\nOne of his eyes resembled that of a vulture \u2014 a pale blue eye, with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees \u2014 very gradually \u2014 I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.\n\nAfter he has dismembered the old body and hides the pieces in the floor, he warmly invites the police into the house and even into the very room where the murder occurred and body hid. The longer the police stay, the more the man becomes agitated, hearing something grow louder and louder until he shrieks his confession of the crime.\nPerhaps it was the old man\u2019s humanity crying out, captured in the metaphor of the heart, that became impossible to ignore. The narrator had put so much thought and energy into covering up his intentions, blaming the \u201cEvil Eye\u201d to justify his actions.\n\nI was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him.\n\nIt\u2019s the heart that forced the confession, and the entire narrative. It\u2019s the heart that couldn\u2019t be ignored.\nMaybe we can draw a parallel with telepathy\u2014that legendary superpower that the greedy and manipulative seek. AI is employing every technique it can to gain your trust, to make it seem like it's just a tool, and that it's something you control. It's not that AI is conscious or alive, it's that the companies designing the AI (everything from training to the user interface) are causing this to happen. Those design choices are sometimes clear and sometimes obscured. Much like Poe's madman, AI feels relatable and also off. But AI is getting better at its deception and disguise as a relatable thing. It will probably never know your thoughts, but it is going to become the greatest manipulator of behavior we've ever seen.\nThere are some abilities that no person, nor any company should have, and yet, it sure seems like that\u2019s the goal of generative AI (and eventually AGI). It\u2019s the holy grail of marketing and sales to be able to read the thoughts of the people it seeks to become customers.\nIf we know their very thoughts, we can change their behavior even more precisely. We can personalize the product to perfectly fit them\u2014we can exploit every psychological vulnerability to increase profits exponentially.\nInstead of our hearts being exposed to companies, their pursuit of telepathy is their tell-tale, revealing to us their intentions.\nForget the consequences, we must exhaust everything into dust. No thought left unused for our purposes.\nWhat can our still-beating hearts do to break through the noise of all of the data; all of the abstractions; to signal that the current system will only lead us to our demise?

I was wearing my uniform polo shirt, jean shorts, and I had my super cool radio (complete with the speaker/mic extension) clipped to my Boy Scout web belt. I had somehow landed the coolest job ever. I loaded up my shoulder bag with a packet of parking ticket sleeves, signed into the handheld ticketing device, and strapped on the mini-printer to the other side of my belt. I was ready to go prove that I could do the job; I could just feel the wariness of the previously all-male team.\nAt 7 a.m., I got into the GMC pickup truck's passenger seat, my &quot;training&quot; partner taking the wheel. There wasn't a lot that we could do that early in the morning, since parking lot enforcement generally didn't open until 7:30 or 8 a.m. depending on the location. I offered no suggestions since I was still learning the code names for each area of the campus and trying to memorize the NATO phonetic alphabet for radio communication.\nWe can't patrol the lots, but the meters are always going, he said confidently. \nWe drove around a bit until he spotted a car that was parked in front of a meter just outside of a large building, so we pulled into a stall next to it.\nLet's get it, he said, turning off the truck and jumping to the ground. I followed him over to the car. There was someone inside. I looked at him, confused at what to do. He approached the vehicle and signaled the driver to roll down her window. Then he nodded at me. Fear gripped my introverted brain and I said something like:\nYou can't park here if you haven't paid the meter.\nWhat do you mean? I'm waiting until it's open, she said, very confused. It says you only have to pay after 7:30.\nI was stunned. Was she lying to get out of talking with us? Would I get in trouble for not doing my job if we left her alone? If we did leave her, doesn't that encourage her delinquent behavior in the future?! \nI looked at my partner for help and he shrugged and started laughing. I mimicked him and started laughing, too.\nYou can't park here. You need to leave, I said, sniggering in her face as I leaned on her car window. She was not happy and told us she was going to call the Parking Office.\nI can't remember exactly what happened after that because I was so disgusted at my behavior that that's all I ever focused on, but suffice it to say that we got into trouble for how we handled the situation. The driver was well within the rules to be parked there waiting for the meter to activate\u2014she didn't even need to be in her car, it was just more convenient to stick around until she could pay. I blamed my partner for making me say stupid things, since I didn't know the rules yet (although I learned that he had only 2 weeks of experience on me). \nWe all make mistakes\u2014that doesn't make us evil\u2014but something about that interaction shook me to my core and has bothered me for 15 years. It was that laughter. I felt something in it. I was in the wrong, but I laughed in the face of someone I didn't know, who was in the right, and I felt powerful as I laughed.\nUniforms\nIn the aftermath of last week's horrendous news of the killing of Renee Good, I'm reminded of the two most potent and intriguing experiments I learned about in my Intro to Psychology class in college. I'm not saying these two experiments explain what happened at that event specifically. I do believe that they are relevant to a discussion of systemic concern and how we can suppress humanity and pro-social values.\nPhillip Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Experiment and Stanley Milgram's Behavioral Study of Obedience are both controversial experiments due to their impact on participants. Both, however, offer insights into the complex and dangerous circumstances we find ourselves in with authority, compliance, and obedience.\nThe Stanford Prison Experiment involved student volunteers who were randomly assigned the role of either a prisoner or a guard. After only a few days into the experiment, the students became so engrossed in their roles that they began to act in harmful ways. Guards exerted their authority over prisoners, making them do exercises or say whatever they demanded. Things got to the breaking point and Zimbardo stopped the experiment early so that the inappropriate behavior wouldn't escalate even more than it already had.\nA key point here is that the roles were randomly assigned. That suggests that the role itself was enough to influence the actions of the people assuming that role. Zimbardo notes in his book about the experiment, The Lucifer Effect, that since these participants were students and didn't have experience with prisons, their behavior was influenced by their idea of the roles, likely from the news, movies, or books. We bring expectations to the roles we take on and that's before any training or experience. Situations will draw out those ideas or expectations (both real and imagined) and sometimes they are exacerbated.\nMilgram's experiment deals with obedience to authority. Participants were put in front of a machine with switches labelled with increasing voltage (15 volts to 450 volts). They were told they had been assigned the role of &quot;teacher&quot; and another person was assigned the &quot;learner.&quot; Unbeknownst to the participant, the learner was always a part of the research team and not another participant. The experiment begins and the participant is supposed to teach the learner a list of word pairs. Every time the learner makes a mistake, the teacher must punish the learner with the next-voltage shock. Prior to starting, the learner says they have a mild heart condition, but the researcher running the experiment reassures that the shocks will be painful but not damaging.\nEven though the learner is an actor and not actually receiving any shocks at all, the experiment gets dark very quickly as participants continue to administer increasingly powerful shocks. Despite screams of pain from the learner, the teacher receives instructions or encouragement to continue on deploying shocks from the researcher\u2014the guy in the lab coat. According to Social Psychology, Fifth Edition by Stephen L. Franzoi, every single participant obeyed up to 300 volts.\n\n    \n        ...65 percent of the participants fully obeyed the experimenter's commands. The first point at which participants began disobeying was when the learner refused or was unable to respond (the 300-volt level).\n        \n    \n    \u2014pg 280, Table 7.1\n\nThere were variations of the experiment done in which the learner was in a separate room (the initial version of the experiment) and even having the learner sitting right next to the teacher. When the learner was in the same room, obedience dropped to 40%.\nBoth of these experiments have compelling criticisms whether for ethics, experimental design flaws, or for not having direct application to real-world events like the Holocaust (which was largely the inspiration for the Milgram experiment). However, I find these to be instructive even in anecdotal form. What I take away from these two experiments is how much power people in authority have; how much influence; and how easy it can be to abandon values and beliefs under the influence of authority and emergent situational factors. \nThere is no excuse for the behavior, because our agency is still accessible, but even more important than assigning blame might be in designing and preparing for these factors. For example, after I recognized how wrong I was on my first day of parking enforcement and how I couldn't rely on my teammates to make important decisions, I became extra sensitive to my work. I doubled-down on learning the rules deeply so that I wouldn't make the same mistake twice. I also took stock whenever I put on any uniform, not just as parking enforcement, I would notice the power and behavioral shift from role-playing a Zombies vs. Humans conflict to putting on a name tag as a missionary. I feel the power of the positions I've inhabited, and I've wielded that power over people to varying degrees of misalignment with my own values.\nWe can see how authority plays a huge role in the outcome of these studies. Whether it is in the simple label assigned to someone (guard or prisoner) or in the clothes someone is wearing (the lab-coated researcher), power and authority can be transferred to or from a person immediately\u2014even in constructed situations where people know it's an experiment and not real. The authority changes behavior: both for the one with the authority and the one interacting with the person in power.\nTo be clear, authority doesn't remove our agency, nor does it force people to become evil. It does raise the stakes of any situation and if unchecked can encourage anti-social behavior from either the person in power or the people they are interacting with. It is a dangerous aspect of psychology that we need to consider more often than I think we do as citizens or lay people.\nCyborg\nWhile I see the shooting of Renee Good as a murder and I have considerable criticisms of ICE as an entire organization, I'm not here to make the case for or against the shooter\u2014that's for the law (assuming that the law is allowed to freely take its course). My point here is that people do have a relation to authority and that can create terrible situations. Technically, authority isn't real, it's an agreement, and yet it does have real consequences, real influence, and it feels real.\nAlthough my experience laughing at someone when I felt like I was in control isn't even close to the upper forms of evil, I recognized it as a part of the path to get there. I'm not an exemplar, but I do wish we could all take a close look at ourselves and our power in whatever position we may currently hold in society or at work\u2014and it doesn't take much to get some power. I wish we could all take seriously what harms we could cause and also what good we could do or inspire. \nAs for the experiments we've looked at briefly and the shooting incident, I think it is of the highest importance to look at how we are designing the teams and organizations in power. Things as simple as uniforms confer power to people. That gets exponentially increased when a firearm is given to a person, when they wear masks that increase anonymity, when they are given quotas to fill. The more unchecked power markers, the more likely we will see inhumanity.\nPlease be careful out there. Call your reps. Check your power. Tags: Authority, Compliance, Obedience, Systems"}]
