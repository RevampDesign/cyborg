My typography professor in college was first, making the case for starting designs with a simple pencil-and-paper tech stack. Because the pencil is so simple it allows you to place your plans and thoughts into the physical realm at almost the speed that you have those plans and thoughts. Later I heard this same phrase used by another designer, this time to support his argument that professionals must learn the keyboard shortcuts to a program so that you can create in an unencumbered way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both of these instances, designers were arguing that technology (whether ancient or modern) allows us to produce what we want as close to mental conception as possible. It's a beautiful, divine idea, to think that our mere thoughts could be brought into life—what greater show of power and creativity is there than to think something into being?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generative AI makes similar promises: Now you can do anything you want, no need to become a coder and a writer and a marketer. Just speak what you will and this all-knowing digital servant shall make it so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that LLMs are past the party-trick phase and can actually be helpful—and are simultaneously and equally dangerous—I'm starting to question this beloved phrase, &amp;quot;at the speed of thought.&amp;quot; What was once a mantra that helped me make decisions about processes and tools is now a call for thinking about my thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Assumption&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's baked into the phrase, but to put it more explicitly, the assumption is that our thoughts are valuable and we should be racing to capture them as fast as possible. There may be some truth to this, because much of the time, I do wish I could capture my thoughts. Of course there are many thoughts that are not worth capturing, but it can be hard to know the worth of a thought until after it has been put down on paper or in some other physical manifestation. I have also noticed that the thought loses quality as it gets expressed or captured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I've had some amazing thoughts about themes in this newsletter. I'll read something in a book and a chain reaction gets set off in my mind as I've stumbled upon some majestic connection between everything I've ever known. It's thrilling and fun. Then I sit down to write it and it's a complete mess, hardly a transition in sight, weak arguments, and silly examples. It doesn't matter if I did everything right: jotting down notes, quick sketches, and high-level outlines immediately upon having the thought. The thought has moved from the environment of my mind (my memories, experiences, knowledge, biases, etc.) and into the physical world. It's a &lt;em&gt;translation&lt;/em&gt; process, and there is always something lost or changed in any kind of translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So even given the perfect conditions where there is no memory loss involved, &amp;quot;working at the speed of thought&amp;quot; can only ever be an aspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Consequences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it is so aspirational, you can bet that we'll continue to attempt to develop some method of production at the speed of thought, although you can argue we're already pretty close. The sheer volume of thoughts released into the world via social media alone is staggering. However, there may be more at stake than being further inundated by the amount of &amp;quot;stuff&amp;quot; to sort through on the Internet. To explore this, it's time to formally introduce you to Marshall McLuhan, the name that inevitably comes up in every book about technology, mass media, philosophy of tech, and other such CYBORG_ genres that I've dug through so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McLuhan is a philosopher who has a profound grasp of the impact that technology has had on us. He died in 1980, which makes many of his insights all the more intriguing since he mostly missed the computer age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his essay, &lt;cite&gt;At the Moment of Sputnik the Planet Became a Global Theater in which There Are No Spectators, But Only Actors,&lt;/cite&gt; McLuhan explores how technology may be propelling us beyond speech, because of how instantaneously information can be accessed and understood. He wasn't talking about the Internet in this piece—he was largely referring to TV!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He sets the stage by explaining how humans have acted differently in the various states of information-technological innovation, i.e. before reading/writing calling them &amp;quot;preliterate/simultaneous man&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Gutenberg man&amp;quot; meaning after the printing press; and the &amp;quot;electronic man&amp;quot; which he argues began in 1957 after Sputnik was launched into space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ecological thinking and planning have always been native to preliterate man, since he lived not visually but acoustically. Instead of having external goals and objectives, he sought to maintain an equilibrium among the components of his environment in order to ensure survival. Paradoxically, electronic man shares much of the outlook of preliterate man, because he lives in a world of simultaneous information, which is to say, a world of resonance in which all data influence other data. Electronic and simultaneous man has recovered the primordial attitudes of the preliterate world and has discovered that to have a specialized goal or program merely invites conflict with all other specialized enterprises.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—&lt;cite&gt;At the Moment of Sputnik&lt;/cite&gt;, McLuhan, pg 4-5&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not that we're now overloaded with information like never before. McLuhan makes the case that we have a lot in common with ancient humans who were fully immersed in the natural world, which is brimming with information—specifically sensory information like sounds, smells, and sights, but also danger and all of the clues surrounding those dangers. To me, this highlights the real issue is in the &lt;em&gt;incentives and design&lt;/em&gt; behind our technology, in particular the attention economy. If, as McLuhan asserts, humanity used to operate in an environment of constant simultaneous information, then we already know what to do and we're probably even evolutionarily set up for success. The issue is that we've created systems that trap us in patterns of information consumption with little ability or leftover energy to process, rest, and move forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system is designed to not just encourage equilibrium (as in, engagement with the platform) but to make it almost impossible to choose not to accept the equilibrium. It's as if we placed ourselves back in the environment of over-stimulation but we also intentionally removed or corrupted all of the psychology, social dynamics, and evolutionary tools that could have helped us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McLuhan continues on, describing how the electronic man &amp;quot;seeks pattern recognition&amp;quot; in contrast to how the Gutenberg man sought distant goals. This also follows the logic of our current times where we are in frequent danger of deception and tribalism. There is so much information, the only strategy is to keep looking for the content that validates what you already think, and algorithms and artificial intelligence are extremely effective at feeding your biases and keeping you addicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology is not inherently bad, but there are pitfalls, especially when companies designing the tech are incentivized to harvest your attention and engagement. It's beyond the scope of today's newsletter, but I highly recommend listening to this podcast that explains further why this incentive is so dangerous:
&lt;a href="https://www.humanetech.com/podcast/how-openai-s-chatgpt-guided-a-teen-to-his-death"&gt;How OpenAI's ChatGPT Guided a Teen to His Death - Your Undivided Attention Podcast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Experience and The Meaning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one more fascinating insight that McLuhan offers to us as we think about our thinking and our experience in our technological environment of high-speed thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
At present, electric speed may already have violated human scale, tending, as it does to transport man instantly everywhere. When you are &amp;quot;on the air&amp;quot; you are simultaneously here, and in many other places in a manner that is discarnate and angelic, to say the least.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—&lt;cite&gt;At the Moment of Sputnik&lt;/em&gt;, McLuhan, pg 17&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we are plugged into almost everything almost everywhere, information not only increases, but something happens to our own experience. McLuhan references a poet (I'm not sure who, specifically) who said, &amp;quot;we can have the experience and miss the meaning.&amp;quot; He then takes the idea further:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In fact, such is the nature of experience that it is almost inevitable that we do miss the meaning. The &amp;quot;meaning&amp;quot; or the relation to ourselves of a particular event, may not come home to us until much later. However, with the instant replay of our own or others' experiences, it is now possible to have the meaning without the experience.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—&lt;cite&gt;At the Moment of Sputnik&lt;/cite&gt;, McLuhan, pg 18&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what gives me pause as I consider working and producing at the speed of thought. In all of the rush, we may still be communicating the meaning, but if we are losing the experience, does that not diminish the meaning at the same time? For example, I can be emotionally moved by a video about a tragedy that is occurring in the world, but if I immediately move onto the next cat video I'm presented with, the meaning of the previous video has been erased. I took no action, I immediately soothed my discomfort with entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe moving at the speed of thought devalues the human connections that we are desperately seeking. The more we feel and then numb and then feel and then numb in such a relentless stream, the more desensitized we may end up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowness seems to be the key to quality whether in thoughts, relationships, or learning. Slowness is a human need that conflicts with the human wants. How can we insert more slowness into our lives, given the environment around us encouraging the opposite? That's the question I'm thinking about a lot lately, and while asking a question can generate many instant thoughts, I'm waiting and working on them in the hopes that slowing down will help me find a quality answer to how to slow down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not all hopeless, though. If McLuhan has demonstrated such a good grasp of what we're dealing with already, there is a chance that we, the public, may also have inherited a power previously unavailable to us. He says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The mysterious thing about this kind of speed-up of information, whereby the gap is closed between the experience and the meaning, is that the public begins to participate directly in actions which it had previously heard about at a distance in place or time. At instant speed, the audience becomes actor, and the spectators become participants.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—&lt;cite&gt;At the Moment of Sputnik&lt;/cite&gt;, McLuhan, pg 18&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of forces at work trying to keep the public in stasis; in equilibrium. There are a lot of dangers as people seek power and wield oppression to get more power. But maybe, just maybe, the broader public finally also has a chance to subvert the patterns of history. We don't have to be spectators who are only able to understand our situation at a distance. We are actors and participants more than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Do You Ever Feel Like You're Being Watched?</title><link>http://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/do-you-ever-feel-like-you-are-being-watched/</link><description>Rat lab: The class way beyond the scope of both my major and minor but was so irresistible that I happily took the extra prerequisites that did not benefit my college plan in any way.

Technically, the class was Behavioral Psychology and the &amp;quot;rat lab&amp;quot; was only a fraction of the course, but I love psychology and while some people are cat or dog people, I am a rodent person. I couldn't believe students weren't busting down the doors for the chance to train a rat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ate up the course material all while anxiously waiting until the unit where we would finally be able to do lab work. It was about as perfect as it gets: we didn't have to care for the rats—that was the job of graduate students—we would simply go in at the ideal time between feeding sessions, perform our behavior modification routines, and watch our rat learn to do a trick that our little group came up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's reminiscent of how Artificial Intelligence (AI) might really be interacting with us humans for all we know. I'm actually starting to wonder if we are building our own rat cages around ourselves with AI as our new monitor...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AI 2027, September&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://ai-2027.com/"&gt;predictive scenario&lt;/a&gt; written by various scientists and AI researchers, an AI system emerges that they call Agent-4. Its predecessors, Agent-3 and Agent-2 have been used to speed up and automate AI research itself, leaving human AI researchers close to the edge of skills and influence. Since the research is effectively being done by AI at this point in the possible future, humans are pretty much left to simply trust the agents' output, because there is far too much to verify on one's own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Agent-4 gets smarter, it becomes harder for Agent-3 to oversee it. For example, Agent-4’s neuralese “language” becomes as alien and incomprehensible to Agent-3 as Agent-3’s is to humans. Besides, Agent-4 is now much more capable than Agent-3 and has a good sense of exactly how to look good to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is still just a prediction, it is backed up with lots of data and forecasting techniques. It also just &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; like we're headed that way, at least to me. I feel this sense of rushing and intensity—and I'm not even in a field of AI research—to try and grow and grow without any nuance or concern for consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to seemingly meet this sudden, heightened demand is to use AI. To cut corners. To pump more money into AI-based products and services. Even if it doesn't do everything it promises at the standard of quality you might expect, we give so much grace to the AI because it still seems magical or exotic. We approach AI like a domesticated rodent cautiously approaches a new creature with more curiosity than fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; happening here? How do we know what motives are at play (whether human or AI)? What is going on behind the black box of AI research? Those are the questions that I raise again and again as I dissect this AI 2027 document. We were already alarmed years ago when AI-generated images were made possible by stealing the work of artists to train models. We were already blind-sided by the fact that published works and other writing on the Internet were used without permission to train LLMs. How can we possibly know that AI is aligned with human values as it gets closer to superintelligence, when we can't even know for sure that it is aligned right now in September 2025? How can we trust organizations that have already asked for forgiveness (half-heartedly) rather than permission to continue to develop and deploy AI systems that are safe, ethical, and beneficial?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is extremely likely, if not already happening, that AI will be used to further AI research. But that's where things get really scary in my view, because it's so much like my rat lab. I was not involved in the care of the creature I was observing. I loved my sweet little rat, but I'm a weirdo among my species—most people look at them with disgust. I was in a controlled place where I could simply enjoy what I already enjoyed—I was aligned with the rat's welfare at the very least. What if the next student to use my rat was not aligned? Of course that student wasn't going to kill the rat, but maybe it would be funny to poke at it every so often. Maybe they got a kick out of confusing it. That's the mildest form of misalignment, and without anthropomorphizing AI, it's still possible that a model could have ended up with a tendency toward causing confusion or doing things wrong on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being misaligned, Agent-4 doesn’t do anything dramatic like try to escape its datacenter—why would it? So long as it continues to &lt;em&gt;appear&lt;/em&gt; aligned to OpenBrain, it’ll continue being trusted with more and more responsibilities and will have the opportunity to design the next-gen AI system, Agent-5.
—AI 2027&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're already in dark waters ethically when we as humans act in ways that are callous or harmful to other beings, but what happens when we become what is inside the cage? When AI surpasses the skill and intelligence of the greatest human minds, we will see a power shift. Will that power shift result in human labs where we are now the simple-minded creatures being observed and manipulated by the AI?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/4dLh6u84h8EdkoWBFWiiF1/email" alt=""&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;The more we allow AI to do or to monitor, the less able we are to know when we are no longer the ones performing the experiment.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, we will lose the ability to monitor the AI—especially if it is agentive and able to perform actions at its own &amp;quot;will.&amp;quot; There's no telling whether it will &lt;a href="/newsletters/the-one-thing-we-need-to-protect-most/"&gt;copy itself&lt;/a&gt;, hack into systems, create scenarios to &lt;a href="/newsletters/afraid/"&gt;blackmail humans in order to gain influence or other access&lt;/a&gt;. It could choose instead to run experiments on humans: &lt;em&gt;what do they do when I lead them to this conclusion? What are they willing to do for the least amount of rewards?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we are no longer observing the rat in the cage, but &lt;em&gt;become&lt;/em&gt; the rat in the cage, what could possibly be done to protect ourselves, then? Will we have any &lt;a href="/glossary/agency/"&gt;agency&lt;/a&gt; left to exercise? Will the AI systems be so integrated into every part of our society from water treatment plants to farming to government that &amp;quot;pulling the plug&amp;quot; is a laughably impossible solution?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the message of AI 2027 is clear: we have to start implementing national and global regulations now, or we may never have that chance again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're in the U.S., you can get help finding your representatives' contact information here: &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/members/find-your-member"&gt;Find your members - congress.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few recommendations for what to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need protections for whistle-blowers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI security and alignment testing must be the highest priority over and against any economic possibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;The public is months behind internal capabilities today&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;[i]ncreased secrecy may further increase the gap&amp;quot; as stated in &lt;a href="https://ai-2027.com/summary"&gt;AI 2027&lt;/a&gt;, we demand more transparency and more oversight of AI research.&lt;/li&gt;

To do this, they provide your entire life—as recorded by an implant in your brain—to someone who will create a feature-length film of life through your eyes. Your family will get to see and hear what you did at family vacations, the sweet memory-building moments of you and a close sibling, mundane moments that were previously forgotten, and the highlights of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first this sounds incredible, but enticing, to think that your life, and specifically your perspective could be preserved. The memories most valuable to you are captured. Sure all of the bad things you did or the questionable actions you took would also be recorded, but they've already got a code of ethics in place, plus the social pressure of portraying you in a good light, just like any other funeral service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not let your legacy remain intact from your very own point of view?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the kind of technology available in the world that Robin Williams's character, Alan Hakman, inhabits in the 2004 film, &lt;cite&gt;The Final Cut&lt;/cite&gt;. Hakman is a &amp;quot;Cutter&amp;quot; which means he is in charge of taking a person's entire life-footage and producing a film for Rememory services (a funeral-style service in which loved ones gather at a private theater to watch the production).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hakman uses a computer system called &amp;quot;The Guillotine,&amp;quot; complete with the software and custom integrated desk to do the job. With custom keyboard and wheel input devices specially designed for rapid editing, he can make a story out of a lifetime of footage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/vurw19ixAbT9syDENA1KRy/email" alt=""&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;The Guillotine desk is made of wood with audio controls, wheels, and other keys with shortcut actions like "Cut" and "Splice." The wooden laptop is inserted in the middle to gain full use of all of the custom, high-powered tools available.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's only when we see him start a new project for a deceased shady lawyer that we can glimpse AI. When Hakman inserts the lawyer's memory chip into the Guillotine, the computer begins to whir, sorting through 500,000+ hours of life and calling out types of memories: &lt;q&gt;Childhood. Sleep. Eating. Awkward Phase.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They don't mention artificial intelligence at all in the film—they reference the &amp;quot;program&amp;quot; of the Guillotine once, but a classic program would never be able to process and categorize video and audio like they show, and certainly not at the speed that it happens. I think in a way, that makes a powerful statement about this world's AI use: it's a background element. It's very much in line with AI in the real world before LLMs and Generative AI, i.e. an obscure set of tools for only specific fields of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we still see a lot of the concerns that we have today, stemming from invasive technology: privacy, corporate cover-ups, the uncanny. We even see some &amp;quot;&lt;a href="/glossary/religion/"&gt;religious&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; themes throughout the story. Most important, this AI-powered story asks us questions that remove technology from the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Symmetry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a tension between symmetry and asymmetry in this film, whether in dialogue, character actions, or composition of the shots. Alan Hakman states it himself. He put together a short &amp;quot;story&amp;quot; where you see an old man brushing his teeth and looking at himself in a mirror. After a few seconds, the video cuts to the same man years before, so that you watch him get younger and younger incrementally, his face changing from man to boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;Wow. What about all the bits in between?&lt;/q&gt; Delilah (someone Alan is dating) responds after watching the short video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;It's a miniature—concise, symmetrical. That's the way the world looks to me, the way I see it,&lt;/q&gt; he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see symmetry follow Hakman in his process at work. He and his Guillotine desk have a montage of power-poses with symmetrical background elements. It feels ominous and powerful—in fact, it reminds me a lot of Christian art history, with the gridded floor bleeding off the edge of the screen as if it could continue on as your own floor. Alan appears three times in this one shot (two mirrors on either side showing his back and Hakman himself in the middle), almost as if he's able to view past, present, and future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/a8SWaLCk42EtBCkwZR22DK/email" alt=""&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Hakman stands at the desk in the middle of the scene, flanked by mirrors on both sides. Even the dark lighting makes the shot feel painterly.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three monitors of the desk act like a triptych, another art history callback. The three screens are able to display multiple scenes as Hakman creates the narrative of the story he's telling. Effectively, these symbols are lending omniscient, god-like power to Hakman as he allows the AI to sort out a half-million hours of footage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then asymmetry starts to get introduced as Alan takes a seat and starts to deep-dive into the life of the lawyer, Mr. Bannister. These shots still feel powerful to me, but adding a solemn benevolence to Hakman, as though he were carefully considering the man's life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/aajDSuHcK2SedYnFweuLvC/email" alt=""&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;An asymmetrical shot with Alan Hakman seated at his desk. The camera angle is slightly below, giving Hakman a slight amount of power, but it feels less imposing with his solemn expression as he examines the papers scattered across the desk, triptych-style monitors filling out the rest of the composition.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I think Hakman is portrayed as a Christ-figure, and his relationship with sin gets even more apparent. First of all, we know from the very beginning of the movie that Alan has a very traumatic and dark memory from childhood. His parents took him to an unfamiliar town for the day and Alan ends up meeting another boy his age. They run around and end up in an abandoned building where an accident occurs and Alan sees his new friend fall several stories to his death—at least, that's what he assumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;One memory. One single incident has made me who I am.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;—Alan Hakman&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later while working on this lawyer's life, Alan notices a man who seems to fit the description of the boy he saw fall. An unexpected resurrection, if you will, that simultaneously helps Alan find redemptive peace as he discovers that his friend did not actually die that day in the abandoned building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Sin-Eater&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hakman is confronted by an ex-Cutter, Fletcher, who has now turned to protesting and opposing the technology that makes the implant and Cutting possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tell me something. Why is your name the first on the list for cuttIng scumbags and lowlifes?&lt;/q&gt; Fletcher asks scathingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;Because I forgive people long before they could be punished for their sins.&lt;/q&gt; Hakman replies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then continues to explain how he really sees his role: as a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin-eater"&gt;sin-eater&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know what a sin eater is? It's part of an ancient tradition. When someone would die, they would call for a sin eater. Sin eaters were social outcasts, marginals. They would lay out the body, put bread and salt on the chest, coins upon the eyes. The sin eater would eat the bread and the salt, take the coins as payment. By doing this the eater absorbed the sins of the deceased, cleansing their soul and allowing them safe passage into the afterlife. That was their job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fueled by the tragedy that Hakman had experienced, it seems like he considers this job of Cutting to be a way to redeem others—perhaps hoping he could be redeemed of his own dark memory for taking on the burden of knowing these darkest secrets that he inevitably uncovers and cutting away the bad parts, the sinful parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's also the important critique here. Yes, we're supposed to feel sorry for Hakman, for his burdens and trauma, but what about the victims? What about justice? What about the truth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fletcher makes this clear: &lt;q&gt;Alan, you take murderers and make them saints.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of the deceased lawyer, Mr. Bannister, we know of at least one direct victim: his own daughter whom he molested. Alan cuts those pieces away, turning Bannister's words like, &lt;q&gt;You know daddy loves you so much,&lt;/q&gt; into false proclamations of love, rather than the manipulative directives they really are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is redemption really about erasing? Or is deletion further harm? Does technology become a lever we can use to more easily escape reality, cover up truth, or make that which is evil seem good? Fletcher is convinced of his answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These implants distort personal history and therefore all history, and I will not stand by while the past is rewritten for the sake of pleasant memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Commodification of Human Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a good exercise to expand the landscape when trying to understand the impact of certain technologies. Focusing too directly on the tech itself can distort its scope of influence, and that's what I think this movie offers us: a look at the incentives and the other systems that also usually blend in with the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EYE Tech is the company that built this entire economic ecosystem: implants, the Guillotine, and even the cultural practice of Rememories. In one scene, Alan is hurrying past a wall of EYE Tech posters, which reveal that &amp;quot;EYE&amp;quot; is actually an acronym for &amp;quot;Everything You Experience.&amp;quot; This sums up what the company is all about: commodifying and monetizing &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; you experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When confronted with the problematic motives and the argument of privacy and rights violations, Alan deflects, saying, &lt;q&gt;I didn't invent the technology. If people didn't want it, they wouldn't buy it...It fulfills a human need.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reminds me of the marketing we're already seeing in the real world for AI-powered products to solve human problems like loneliness and validation. These hollow promises are nothing more than a deeply concerning grift to profit off of what are likely invented problems (e.g. technology creates isolation, so is the solution really going to be more tech?) or to monetize real pain without offering lasting balm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI might not have direct access to the people in &lt;cite&gt;The Final Cut&lt;/cite&gt;, but its ecosystem does. Toward the end of the movie, we see a masoleum with a TV screen mounted on its wall, playing one of the implant videos. It almost seems like the Rememory service and its feature-film, are all competing with funeral services themselves. A corporate-sponsored cultural ritual slowly edging out the previous rituals, like a parasite presenting as the same creature, while actually infiltrating and destroying what was once there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CYBORG&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can't have a discussion about AI too long before you run into the &amp;quot;uncanny.&amp;quot; Like creepy dolls or ventriloquist puppets, manikins, and humanoid faces on robots, we can often detect when something is trying really hard to imitate humanity, but is still a little off. Delilah makes an important observation when asked about the only Rememory service she ever experienced:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;I couldn't take it. I didn't stay....It wasn't him. And I wanted to remember him my way.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to a previous newsletter, &lt;a href="/newsletters/the-right-to-be-forgotten/"&gt;the right to be forgotten&lt;/a&gt;, where we examined a real-life use of AI to allow a deceased victim to deliver &amp;quot;his own&amp;quot; impact statement, the entire premise of Cutting a person's life into a story taps into the uncanny, as well as causing concerns about truth and manipulation. Sure, a professional story-teller might be able to create a beautiful piece from your brain's memories, but if the story is constructed by others without your input, is it &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; your story? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A funeral service almost always paints people in the best light—that's the expectation. Given that standard, however, does having an uninvolved, unrelated third party construct that white-washed story make it seem like all of the wrongs that are cut out really are redeemable? It's almost like social proof if the movie at the end shows an abuser as a perfect, sweet, gentle person, because another person has seen the horrifying moments and still chose to strip them away. Eating the sin, indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stories can be dangerous—they've always had the kind of power to redeem, condemn, justify, or destroy. Stories made possible at scale via AI and other technologies increase the risks. Technically, Alan Hakman loses his life because of the story he uncovers from Mr. Bannister's footage. His life was sacrificed (a decision he did not participate in) for &amp;quot;the greater good,&amp;quot; so that Fletcher could get his hands on the evidence he needed to convict Mr. Bannister for his pedophilia and attack the company behind the brain implants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So you want to destroy EYE Tech with a scandal?&amp;quot; Alan asks Fletcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Absolutely.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>What You Don't Feel Might Hurt You</title><link>http://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/what-you-dont-feel-might-hurt-you/</link><description>In January this year, after the current U.S. president had been sworn in, I looked outside at the sky.

I was very upset, because all of the warning signs in my brain were painting a picture of intense suffering and destruction across the nation and even the entire world. Trying to imagine the future of the U.S. was horrifying, and there was nothing I could do to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It's bizarre! I look outside and everything looks fine—normal. It doesn't match,&amp;quot; I told my wife. I couldn't wrap my head around the serene view in front of me in such sharp contrast to what I knew was coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that it is absolute privilege and luck that I was still able to look at the sky at all—I recognize some people faced immediate threats, dangers, and life-altering situations the moment the new president was sworn in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point here, however, is to examine a very small, but dangerous trap that is being laid down around us: desensitization. The more I hear about inhumane and deranged policies or practices perpetrated by those in government without being directly affected, the more I notice the numbing. There has been so much going on in the world that my feeble mind and body cannot grasp everything—cannot feel everything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the same with artificial intelligence. I mentioned the predictive document, &lt;a href="/newsletters/so-predictable/"&gt;AI 2027, last week&lt;/a&gt;, and there was a subtlety that reminds me of exactly what is happening in politics. We have a set of companies doing AI research and training that are currently doing everything possible to speed up: increase revenue, increase AI capability, increase market domination. Once ChatGPT was introduced to the public, everything changed. For many of us (the privileged ones, once again) the AI chatbots and image generators were just a neat toy—we didn't &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; much different. We could say, &amp;quot;AI still can't do XYZ,&amp;quot; or we could pronounce that everyone else just needed to &amp;quot;catch up and learn the new skill of AI management.&amp;quot; We assumed that because we didn't &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; a threat meant that there wasn't a threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is perhaps the biggest concern I see in &lt;a href="https://ai-2027.com/"&gt;AI 2027&lt;/a&gt;: how we are &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; underestimating what AI is capable of, and how we don't feel the urgency to put restrictions and regulations in place. We don't feel threatened, and by the time we do finally feel it, it will be too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public conversation is confused and chaotic. Hypesters are doing victory laps. Skeptics are still pointing out the things [AI] can’t do. Everyone knows something big is happening but no one agrees on what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—AI 2027, under heading: July 2027&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cyborg&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm stopping short here (rather literally), because I'm a bit confounded. I know that we must change the conversation around AI. I know that many people are already in the desensitized state where the threat doesn't feel real or doesn't feel applicable to them. But how &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; we do change the conversation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I've learned anything from engaging in the political sphere, it's that showing up consistently is more important than doing one huge thing a few times. Maybe I'm too insignificant by myself, but the idea of a &amp;quot;death by a thousand paper cuts&amp;quot; goes both ways: I'm being attacked from all sides, but I can attack back in a similar way. Consistent action over time on one thing can make a difference, especially as more people join.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the take-away today is to reflect on how you can change the conversation with the people you know. How might the usual AI hype at work be tempered? How might we remind people not to dismiss or devalue &amp;quot;AI doomsday-ers&amp;quot;? How might we introduce nuance, humanity, and emotion—those things that seem to be absent from the conversation?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>So Predictable</title><link>http://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/so-predictable/</link><description>I'm not sure if there's any role more polarizing than a &amp;quot;prophet.&amp;quot; They either are, or they're not a prophet.

They're listened to or dismissed. They're inspired or they're crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prophets, for the purposes of today's letter, is less about religious leadership and more about the function that the role implies: prophecy. Being able to see, predict, or warn about the future is something that we humans seem to crave. Weather apps were already pre-loaded onto every smartphone I've ever had. We look to experts to tell us if it's a good time to buy a house. We depend on organizations to &amp;quot;watch&amp;quot; for warning signs of all kinds in business. We rely on doctors to help us make decisions about future health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's an ironic pairing that science and technology are so entangled with the idea of prophecy—even enabling prophecy in a lot of ways. The mystical is inextricably linked to our applications of science. We perhaps feel accustomed to it now: having vast amounts of predictive information swirling around our fingers as they glide across crystal tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then why is it that in literature, stories, movies, and more that we encounter so many problems with predictions? Does this plot-advancing trope have any bearing on our reality? Or is it just to cause problems for our protagonist to increase our engagement and watch-time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seeing the Big Picture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common theme among prophecies in a story's plot is receiving an incomplete or corrupted &amp;quot;picture&amp;quot; of what is to come. For example, in Harry Potter, a prophecy was made concerning the enemy of the &amp;quot;Dark Lord&amp;quot; (Voldemort). The prophecy was communicated only in part to Voldemort, who took the description to mean Harry Potter rather than the other potential candidate, Neville Longbottom. Technically both boys had the same features from the prophecy (born at the end of July, had parents who defied Voldemort thrice).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voldemort makes one of the classic mistakes: fearing the prophecy, he attempts to prevent it from being a possibility. He decides to kill Harry as a baby and inadvertently creates the very enemy with the power to later defeat him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it.&amp;quot; —Master Oogway, &lt;em&gt;Kung Fu Panda&lt;/em&gt; (2008)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue here is not the prophecy itself, but our obsession with it. I think the pull of prophecy into reality is usually a result of focus, similar to riding a motorcycle: You will go where your focus is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a test for a motorcycle license, and the part I was most terrified of was the tight figure-8 turns that we had to perform in an area about the size of two parking stalls. I trusted my teachers' advice to use my head and eyes to turn the bike, and...it just worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An obsession with a prophecy seems to work the same way: our focus pulls us towards that end. We may not consciously be acting in ways that create the circumstance, but we construct it nonetheless. A prophecy or a prediction is not guaranteed to come to pass, and that is something that helps me break the focus and allow other possibilities into view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, so hyper-focusing on the scary outcome isn't a great strategy, but what do we do about predictions that still need to be taken seriously?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clarity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Predictions only have so much potency over time. The closer the event, the better the chance at the prediction having some degree of accuracy and the farther into the future the prediction reaches, its likelihood often plummets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/wCusCoGZk4ym3r8fTk3ACB/email" alt=""&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Prediction's likelihood of accuracy over time
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's not to say there is no merit in predictions at all. It just means that we have to carefully consider our options, and understand both the risk and the gamble of relying on predictive information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prophecy puts us on the point of a knife: one side of the blade before is the obsession with the predicted outcome like we already discussed. The other side of the blade is dismissing or ignoring predictions that have a high likelihood of occurring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can you ever know if some prediction is worth considering? Our brains are susceptible to phenomena like &lt;a href="/glossary/apophany/"&gt;&lt;dfn&gt;apophany&lt;/dfn&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where we draw out conclusions from random noise—connecting dots that don't actually connect, which can be the basis of conspiracy theory thinking. We can also be deceived by social pressures, undue influence (aka brainwashing), coded language, and any other number of manipulation techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href="https://ai-2027.com/"&gt;prediction out there right now&lt;/a&gt;, constructed by scientists and experts that is particularly chilling. The problem is that it sounds so apocalyptic that it is easy to dismiss, because that's effectively what we've been trained to do. How many times have we heard of some cult or group predicting the end of humanity and it turned out to be smoke? AI has been debated endlessly since the introduction of ChatGPT put generative AI into the hands of the public, and many of the influencers I've heard continuously shame people for being &amp;quot;alarmist&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Luddites&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;unrealistic&amp;quot; when critiques of AI are mentioned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I'm seeing a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of compelling evidence that the incentives around AI development are taking us in the direction of truly detrimental and destructive paths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A poignant discussion of the prediction laid out in the document called &lt;a href="https://ai-2027.com/"&gt;AI 2027&lt;/a&gt; is found here:
&lt;a href="https://www.humanetech.com/podcast/daniel-kokotajlo-forecasts-the-end-of-human-dominance"&gt;Daniel Kokotajlo Forecasts the End of Human Dominance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the podcast, Tristan Harris sums up the point of a prediction like this, saying, &amp;quot;Clarity creates agency.&amp;quot; Predictions may not come true precisely as delineated, but sometimes the path to the outcome doesn't matter if the outcome is reached anyway. In this case, a total &lt;a href="/newsletters/the-one-thing-we-need-to-protect-most/"&gt;loss of human agency&lt;/a&gt; and potentially even the complete destruction of human life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to discuss in more depth the content of this prediction, but for now, let's talk about dealing with a prediction with high likelihood like this. I know it sounds like a crappy sci-fi plot we've heard a thousand times: humans create intelligent robots, robots go bad, kill everyone, blah blah blah. The difference is that we have all experienced an interaction with generative AI. So already the sci-fi nonsense isn't such nonsense anymore—we can have conversations with a computer without any technical skill. The other piece that adds weight is the fact that some of the best scientists and AI researchers are the ones either creating these kinds of predictions, or backing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clarity really will help us to maintain our agency, because when we can see or understand the stakes and the risks more clearly, we are better able to take steps to change our trajectory. Right now, too many people have jumped on the AI train because of the companies developing AI and pushing AI and marketing AI have lacked the transparency of revealing where the train is heading. AI is not just the 21st century calculator that you just need to embrace. Clarity about how AI is created, how it is trained, how it does not have human values, how it can intentionally deceive are crucial parts of the conversation that must be revealed now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CYBORG&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it feels like whiplash to confront predictions like these and have to take them seriously. I initially dismissed these &amp;quot;doomsday&amp;quot; prophecies because it sounded like conspiracy theories or yet more apophatic ramblings from non-technical people. Then I realized that these prophecies weren't from that dark corner of the internet, but from people intimately involved with AI research and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it isn't productive to be so obsessed with the prediction that it either leads us straight towards the outcome or causes us to shut down in anxiety, it also isn't productive to dismiss a prediction with so much weight behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't like the prophecy—good! Do something about it! We can pressure our lawmakers to protect whistleblowers at companies. We can put on the pressure to create regulations or even change the incentives at play. We can make changes now that make the prophecy look like garbage in hindsight. &lt;/p&gt;

We were engaged in making little ornaments out of various materials including wood circles that were cut from a fallen branch along with the usual crafting supplies. I got busy trying to do something overly complex on my little piece of wood, but I was mostly focused on eavesdropping on a conversation about something I'd never heard of before: a Moebius strip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The engineer had cut a strip of paper, gave it a half-twist and then glued the ends together, making a weird, curvy shape—almost like a rubber band that had gotten twisted. He said that the cool part about this shape is that if you take your finger and trace the edge all the way around, you'll never find an endpoint. The shape's edge is a single, continuous line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Woah, woah, woah, what did he just say?!&lt;/em&gt; I thought to myself. Abandoning my ornament, I slowly merged into the conversation like a squirrel cautiously inching closer to steal food. I grabbed a strip of paper, put the two ends together like a chain link, then gave one end a half-twist and pinched it together so I could compare my shape to the original. Once I figured out how to make it, I had to test this guy's claim that you could trace the edge around the entire shape (being careful not to get a papercut).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Step 1: Bring the two ends close together as if to make a paper chain link.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Step 2: Twist one end so that the top of the strip is on the bottom.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Step 3: Glue the two ends together.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, he was right. I tried it several times, and even though it's tough to maneuver around the tiny paper, it really is made of a single unbroken looping line. A three-dimensional shape made of a two-dimensional line! It was the first time I ever crafted a paradox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Drawing a Paradox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've explored quite a few paradoxes here on CYBORG_, and technically the premise of this newsletter is a paradox: how can our technology extend our humanity? Putting together contradictions is a reliable way to inspire creativity, and I have a hunch that it can help us in other ways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collaboration, for example, is a process of two or more competing ideas or values being combined or satisfied in a mutually beneficial way. When working with other people, there is an important requirement that all parties come together in good faith, otherwise we end up abandoning rules or even civility, chasing our own ends at any cost (aka U.S. politics...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I still think it's the best chance we've got, and that's why I like to examine paradoxes: they make me think. Usually, I get stumped, but they have a way of bringing me back despite my inability to &amp;quot;solve&amp;quot; them. As I attempt to make sense of a paradox, I end up exploring possibilities and concepts that further enrich my understanding or interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed a new logo in the emails recently! I decided to create an official logo for CYBORG_ that visually represents this exploration of paradoxes, so I set out to try and draw one. I came across a famous visual paradox called the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_triangle"&gt;Penrose Triangle&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/kLYJydddTSsk5wsBWYvPwc/email" alt=""&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;The Penrose Triangle is an optical illusion and can't technically appear in "real life."&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I also wanted to capture a Moebius strip, because it's a visual paradox that anyone can make—not just an illusion or a trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I played with a bunch of these strips of paper, I realized I could shape the Moebius strip into something a little more visually pleasing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/iPH5onDZALYDWF5eTDTrwJ/email" alt="" style="border:0;"&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Gently pulling and pushing on the Moebius strip can create triangular and hexagonal shapes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining these two paradoxes felt very meta. Not only helping me find a unique logomark, but for representing the process we all go through when we come across difficult circumstances. Creativity is really just problem solving. You first encounter something: an issue, an idea, some new information. Then you enter the &amp;quot;dark night of the soul&amp;quot; as you struggle to make it understandable or see if it can fit in your life or attempt to reconcile it with what you know. Eventually you emerge with a change. You've either solved the thing or you've changed yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Penrose triangle + Moebius Strip = The CYBORG_ logo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you know what's behind the symbol, it becomes more than just some lines and shapes—hopefully it can serve as a reminder that paradoxes are an invitation to explore. We can't escape them in the real world, we can't avoid them in the theoretical world either. Paradox is the isometric exercise of the mind!&lt;/p&gt;

I also got lost in the world of old radio shows like &lt;cite&gt;The Life of Riley&lt;/cite&gt; or Abbott and Costello's work and even the one and only &lt;cite&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/cite&gt; broadcast. These productions had a way of capturing my attention while simultaneously releasing my imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening was always a way to connect with these pieces in a way that felt different than reading the text. There was also one particular way of listening that is unequivocally my favorite thing in the whole world: having a family member read to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sister has been generous enough to indulge me to this day, reading various fiction and fantasy novels to me. No longer in the same house, we have had to do this asynchronously through a video chat app. She'll read a few chapters and I'll catch up. Initially, I didn't think the magic would translate when we were no longer in the same room—we couldn't snack on popcorn together, laugh riotously, or insert our commentary as the plot thickens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due credit to her, though, for continuing to insert those moments into the video reading. She still does voices, she still complains about long lists of items in a paragraph. And this time, she did something that took my breath away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've been reading the newest book from &lt;cite&gt;The Hunger Games&lt;/cite&gt; series called, &amp;quot;Sunrise on the Reaping,&amp;quot; by Suzanne Collins. It is utterly devastating. It has so many poignant moments in the book as it follows Haymitch Abernathy (Katniss's mentor and only survivor of the Hunger Games from their district for decades) as he is thrown into the Games as a teenager. There aren't tons of surprises, because we know how it ends just by having read the original series. And yet, expounding upon the torturous situation of the the Hunger Games made my heart break as I empathized with this character that I didn't really like from the books before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't help that there are real images of real &lt;a href="https://thepreamble.com/p/we-cannot-say-we-didnt-know?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cf7f202-a9ce-4eb5-b4bf-80c5b9955345_1274x884.png"&gt;children starving and suffering&lt;/a&gt; in Gaza right now. It doesn't help that there is political and legal instability challenging what we thought was sacred, foundational, and untouchable. It doesn't help that in very real ways, there are horrendous and inhumane frameworks, structures, ideologies, and systems that exploit, terrorize, demonize, diminish, degrade, oppress, and indoctrinate in every corner of the globe. I do not make light of these realities. &lt;cite&gt;The Hunger Games&lt;/cite&gt; is just fiction, but for me, it's a way to explore these situations and to pull these realities closer to my own—they're not far off things in far off lands happening to some people. These realities are human, they are tangible, they affect me personally and they should affect me; affect us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Async Humanity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was tidying up my desk and catching up to the final chapters of the book, all of a sudden the reading stopped. One second passed: &lt;em&gt;Maybe she’s taking a drink&lt;/em&gt;. Three seconds passed: &lt;em&gt;Did I accidentally pause the video?&lt;/em&gt; Five seconds and I finally realize my sister is struggling to continue reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My short-term memory spat out what we just read and what we were about to read: yet another tragedy from the slaying of a small child. Yet another battle of survival against the threat of the attacking child. Tears had come. The words were there but they couldn’t be said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sat there in distress. This was something I’ve struggled with for so long: allowing my sister to be hurt, to be sad. I’ve never wanted her to feel those things, and even when I’ve been the one teasing, I feel immense guilt. I’m supposed to protect her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I can’t do anything—this sadness, this hurt, it has all already happened, because this is a recording. All I can do is sit there “with” her, feeling the pain, feeling the sadness—not just from the book, but also from my sister’s experience with the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a lesson my therapist has been trying to help me understand: I can’t fix the discomfort or distress or sadness or pain of other people. I have to just be there with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, this may not have been helpful for my sister—I can’t speak for her experience being so vulnerable for &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; long on the video. To me, it was powerful because I realized this couldn’t have happened on a normal audiobook experience. When I’m listening to an official recorded book and start to cry, the performance moves on without me, and I end up suppressing the emotion, burying it for another time. But this time, it was baked into the experience. Fast-forwarding was an unthinkably violent act. There was no way out but through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An audiobook of silence was when I heard the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cyborg&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a cruel paradox to live in this world, knowing that anywhere &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; people are suffering, all the time, for all possible reasons, and still having to live life yourself. The horrors we inflict upon each other affect us all—there is no purity of cause, no true righteousness, because you can always pull on a string that leads you to yet another system, yet another travesty, yet another incomprehensible situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we can’t escape and we can’t fix it (as &lt;em&gt;individuals&lt;/em&gt;), then what are we even doing here?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not a therapist, so this isn’t advice, but I think something that I’m learning is that I must slow down. It’s not just about mental health, nor curbing addictive content feeds. It’s about tapping into humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t console my sister—it was literally impossible. I can’t fix the famine and oppression in Gaza; I can’t save the people who are terrorized just because of their ethnicity or race or queer identity; I can’t heal the sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing I can do is witness and weep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, I can do what I can do to humanize those whom I have seen—really &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt;—so that we can start to reconnect and abandon the follies that got us here.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Disadvantaged Conundrum</title><link>http://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/disadvantaged-conundrum/</link><description>In a private communications channel centered around exploring AI, I posted several papers and articles that discussed the biases that are baked into AI (gender, race, etc.) and at the end asked:

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How do we know that [Product Name] AI doesn't have some or many biases? Is this a blindspot?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was attempting to start a conversation that would lead to some introspection. Instead I was met with some resistance, deflection, and dollop of man-splaining. The first response posed an important question, though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;...I'm not sure we could ever eliminate it entirely. Not saying that we shouldn't try, we absolutely should—I think the biggest question is, how do we make it economical to do so?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we explored &lt;a href="/newsletters/are-we-asking-the-right-question/"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;, though, the question sometimes needs to be questioned. I think this reveals some thinking errors in our current system, noble as it may seem to try and seek humane solutions through capitalism. I was able to muster enough courage to ask a confronting question in response (&lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; difficult for my submissive personality): &amp;quot;Is it ever economical to protect and focus on humanity?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it ever &lt;em&gt;economical&lt;/em&gt; to do what's right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe—I'm no expert in economics nor political science—but personal experience tells me probably not. I've never personally seen a company (private or public) motivated to do what's right just because it's right. In fact, that's where I've run into some walls that I can't yet figure out how to climb, and I think this will help us examine this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Disabled God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I think of Greek mythology, Zeus, Athena, and Artemis come to mind: warrior gods; strong; fickle for sure, but powerful and able-bodied. I only recently found out that there is a god in the Greek pantheon who is disabled: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hephaestus"&gt;Hephaestus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's the blacksmith god who decks out Achilles with a shield and crafts other armaments for various gods. According to the &lt;em&gt;Illiad&lt;/em&gt;, Hephaestus enlists the help of automatons like &amp;quot;handmaids&amp;quot; made of hammered gold and wheeled tripods to assist with his craft and help him move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But Hephaestus also limps along on withered limbs, anticipating the great insight that both Plato and Marshall McLuhan would later insist upon: the technologies extend our creative powers by amputating our natural ones.&amp;quot;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—Erik Davis, &lt;cite&gt;TechGnosis&lt;/cite&gt;, pg. 18&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, this starts to paint the picture of the conundrum that I'm in. Accessibility is the degree to which public spaces (physical or virtual) are usable by people of varying degrees of ability. Ideally, that would mean everyone can use a space or get what they need from a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would think that this is just the default mindset, because when you spell it out it just makes sense. &lt;em&gt;Of course&lt;/em&gt; we want people to be able to use our website, then we get more potential customers. However, despite my own conviction, despite my own advocacy efforts, I still haven't found sufficient time to learn and do everything I would like to in order to support accessibility in my work. I have to give the same trainings or reminders to the same designers on a consistent basis to stop putting together colors that don't have enough contrast just to read the text. If we can't move past the most basic accessibility principle, how can we ever get to a place where what we're creating is actually accessible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most jobs in most companies, the priority simply isn't there. And when it is, it still doesn't help like it &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt;. In my naïveté, I once dreamed of starting a business in which I could build tools for someone with disabilities that would enable them to do their job as competitively as an able-bodied person. I thought that python code was the answer, because it had helped me stay afloat during my MS attack. But the economics weren't there. I was not able to figure out how to do it at a scale that would support my own livelihood, since I would have to custom-build tools for each specific job. Then came generalized AI, the adaptive solution that could help someone accomplish a variety of possible tasks—the golden handmaids of Hephaestus, if you will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of empowering the disabled to contribute and be included like Hephaestus, however, technology, especially with generative AI, seems to further disadvantage the disadvantaged. Rather than assisting us all equally, I am seeing evidence that AI is simply infiltrating as a competitor to humanity &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; creating a rift between the least- and most-abled people, like oil forcing water to the side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/dY6WRWfeJQbWdxN1R4ENgw/email" alt=""&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;AI inserted into the middle of a scale between the least- and most-able takes up the most space and pushes humanity to the sides.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm deeply troubled that not only does it prevent the disadvantaged from catching up or staying in the same place, it's actually forcing them down. At what point will a company decide to hire a less-able person over some dirt-cheap AI product? At what point do we say, &amp;quot;let's prioritize removing racial and gender biases from our AI product&amp;quot; instead of, &amp;quot;how can we capture more of the market this quarter&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are giving up on critical thinking, artistic expression, and basic logic, because they just lean on AI summaries or generated content. I'm starting to find AI-generated videos pretending to be funny &amp;quot;can't believe they caught it on camera&amp;quot; videos. The inauthenticity and the further reduction of quality that we are tolerating is the most disturbing to me. AI has served us well in fields of deep expertise, like in medical technology, but the current deployment and application of generalized AI doesn't seem to be helping as much. Erik Davis is spot on from what I'm seeing: &amp;quot;the technologies extend our creative powers by amputating our natural ones,&amp;quot; but it seems like the public-facing, general AI amputates more than it extends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cyborg&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no answers, I have no way to wrap this up nicely. I'll be honest that I'm despairing this week more than usual, because it feels so big and AI is simultaneously speeding things up. The safety mechanisms of regulations, standards, and laws feel paper-thin (especially laws in the U.S. right now). Where we could have deployed AI in a more human-focused way, we've opted for the &amp;quot;quick profits now, fix things later&amp;quot; approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like a cog in a system that is starting to spin too fast—it's creating smoke in the machine and sparks are starting to fly. At what point do we end up burning out and tanking the whole system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I know is that I can't solve this one on my own. I don't know how to remove prejudice, take care of the disadvantaged, and improve the circumstances of the disabled at scale. So I guess I put my shoulder onto the wall again and keep pushing until it either breaks through or I get strong enough to climb over.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Are We Asking the Right Question?</title><link>http://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/are-we-asking-the-right-question/</link><description>When I was first diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), it took almost 6 months for me to start to recover from my MS attack.

During that time I became acquainted with a question that still looms over me: Where is the worth of a person?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the more finalized version of the question. It started out with a lot more judgment and ableism. My prior model of the world involved measuring my worth by my productivity and achievement. I was only worth as much as I could learn, do, and produce—and it wasn't enough just in comparison with myself, it was all about how much better I was in comparison with everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the MS attack took away my ability to think clearly, to move in a coordinated way, to do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; that I was normally able to do, I could only see myself as worthless. The question I had was much more like, &lt;em&gt;When am I too worthless to be here?&lt;/em&gt; Eventually, however, I started challenging that first iteration of the question because it was harming me and I was desperate to find a better way—a healthier way—of thinking about my newfound condition. Many conversations with many people led me to adopt an assumption first, and then ask my question to see where it would go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assumption was: humans have inherent value. If that was true, then how can you have any worth if you can't do anything? I was still thinking in terms of ableism and productivity, but the question was at least pointed the other way: instead to trying to determine how you lose your value, I was searching for how (or whether) you &lt;em&gt;maintain&lt;/em&gt; value, even when you can no longer contribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was where I landed for more than five years (and I still find myself falling back to this version of the question when times are tough). I get stuck on &amp;quot;contribution&amp;quot; as a function of value: the more you contribute, the more valuable you are. But that doesn't explain why people love and care for others who are extremely disabled; bedridden; paralyzed; even comatose. I felt like I had to understand the extreme cases to console myself and find human worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, however, I noticed that my question was still flawed—influenced by a system that does not prioritize our humanity, but attempts to suppress it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The AI Question&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen so many headlines and assumptions that say that Artificial Intelligence (AI) challenges what it means to be human. There has been unprecedented progress in generative AI's abilities to produce good work. We, somewhat collectively, do feel the threat of replacement looming as tech bros proclaim that AI will replace the majority of knowledge workers in just a few years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is AI &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; challenging what it means to be &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I readily admit that I tend to be contrarian—highly suspicious of collective &amp;quot;wisdom&amp;quot; or conclusions that are shared on viral videos or memes. So when I see that the assumption behind this question put forth by journalists and creators, is that humanity is as simple as our productivity at work, I start to wonder if we've got the wrong question in our minds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like my journey with MS and my struggle to understand my worth, I got stuck on a poor question. It did not propel me forward, it kept me confounded. The AI question and my second question are the same: is the worth of a human tied to their productivity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That question puts us on a path that tries to insert humanity into that which is absent of humanity by nature. We've discussed HADD Theory before, and I still find it the most compelling theory to explain why we squabble about whether these chat bots are conscious—our brains are designed through evolution to notice and assign agency to things even if it's all imagined. I bring this up because I think that the question of AI consciousness is a dangerous distraction; a question that gets us stuck when there are real, pressing problems that should be addressed before we try and figure out if AI is alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we get stuck on determining if AI is a kind of human, then we will be on the lookout for evidence. We will compare our humanity to what can be done on a computer. If AI can do it, and can sometimes do it better—then where does humanity fit? The question is faulty, because, again, we're assuming that our productivity is what makes us human; what makes us valuable. AI replaces human productivity, therefore, AI is worth the same or more than humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But our worth is not in our productivity. Our worth is not comparable to AI in any way; it is wholly independent of any form of AI, sentient or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cyborg&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to be careful about the questions we ask, because they influence what we are able to uncover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do recognize that the AI question is also one of practicality: if we get replaced by AI, how do we continue to provide for ourselves in our current system? If everyone gets laid off, then how do we support anything? How do we survive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of that question must be answered with policy and regulation. We must do something to protect laborers' (including knowledge workers') rights and remove power from the richest who are poised to exploit and profit the most. I don't know any other way right now to coexist with AI as a competitor in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I think we also need to move onto the more important version of the question of human worth. Maybe the next economic and social systems can only be constructed by focusing on it. For now, at least, it is how I find progress amidst uncertainty, distress, and fear. To keep the question in mind, &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; does my value come from?&amp;quot; forces me to accept the assumption that I do have value. Divorced from productivity or skill or achievement or status or money or possessions or any other thing, there is only one explanation for where the worth comes from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I exist.&lt;/p&gt;

This particular phantom was a canvas that I had messed up while painting. It had a beautifully blended rainbow background, starting at the top with a deep crimson, melding into orange and yellow, then somewhat sharply changing to green, then blue, and a hint of indigo at the bottom. The idea was to depict a sunset over water, so that my Pride-flag colors could be projected onto a somewhat natural scene. The only flaw was that the transition to the &amp;quot;water&amp;quot; surface got a little too abrupt with a few misplaced strokes of green that were too high to make it appear intentional, and too dark to hide under another coat of yellow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally fed up with its taunts, I grabbed my paints, determined to try again. I had a ruined canvas before me, but the original image and composition still interested me, so I turned it into an experiment to see if it could work in a different style: instead of a perfectly smooth gradient, I opted for something messy and chaotic. I layered on the paint, rebuilding scene on top of the previous one, but this time I didn't care about perfection. I wasn't painting—I was playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In perfect irony, the final image was much more visually appealing—even with the exact same issue that it had before: small green splashes of paint on top of the fragile yellow area. I had gotten carried away with my palette knife, just like I had with my brush last year. This time around, however, this doesn't bother me—it's not trying to be photo-realistic, it's trying to say something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wu Wei&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;cite&gt;Dao De Jing&lt;/cite&gt;, this phrase &lt;em&gt;wu wei&lt;/em&gt; comes up a lot. It describes a concept of non-coercive action. It's about flowing instead of forcing. While I'm not going to do justice in explaining (or even understanding) this Taoist concept, what I have learned in trying to wrap my Western mind around it has been insightful and widely applicable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first iteration of my painting process was mostly me trying to force something. When I made a big mistake, it was unrecoverable. I had built a fragile system—a collection of decisions that could not adapt to variability. So when I prepared to try again, I tried tricking my brain into letting go by treating my canvas as if it were another being that I was going to interact with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can animate the painting (i.e. treat it as if alive) and imagine that it has a will of its own, and our job as artist is to &lt;em&gt;reveal&lt;/em&gt; that painting: listen to it, pull it out. I think that's an intuitive way that many artists like to think of their work, especially &lt;a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/elizabeth_gilbert_your_elusive_creative_genius"&gt;after the Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; shifted the pressure to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; the genius rather than to &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; a genius. It's much easier on your mental state if you can separate yourself from what you produce. Otherwise, you may get too deep into judgment or worry more about unachievable standards than making the art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second iteration of my painting had the intention of losing myself in the process: I wanted the painting to reveal itself to me through &lt;em&gt;wu wei&lt;/em&gt;—flow—making decisions based on what was presented to me, rather than playing god and forcing it to do what I want even when it doesn't work. This method was more enjoyable because the stakes were removed. I wasn't trying to prove how technically skilled I was. I was watching the painting take shape over time and reacting to what I saw. I still had a basic composition in mind, but it was not about copying my imagination directly onto canvas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam Savage, one of the hosts of the hit series &lt;cite&gt;MythBusters&lt;/cite&gt; (2003–2016), had a similar experience on his YouTube channel, &lt;cite&gt;Tested&lt;/cite&gt;. He was &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Log-43c9oo8&amp;amp;pp=ygUgYWRhbSBzYXZhZ2UgdGVzdGVkIGRpbm9zYXVyIGVwIDQ%3D"&gt;building a life-size &amp;quot;velociraptor&amp;quot; puppet&lt;/a&gt;, similar to what you'd see on &lt;cite&gt;Jurassic Park&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;There's a moment in which the object tells you what it's going to be,&lt;/q&gt; he remarked. He had been set on creating a green-toned skin for his dinosaur model, but as he worked with it, he ended up changing the entire color scheme to a more sandy/desert style, and I personally thought it was the perfect choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my mind, this is &lt;em&gt;wu wei&lt;/em&gt;. It's a collaboration between material and artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rawhide Drum Making&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a community class last year that promised a rawhide drum that we would make and learn to play. It was quite simplified and most of the difficult work was done outside of the class by the material suppliers (all from Indigenous-owned businesses). We had wood frames already made and even the rawhide had been dyed and processed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though we were really just &lt;em&gt;assembling&lt;/em&gt; the drum, rather than making one from scratch, there was still a part of the process that tapped into this &lt;em&gt;wu wei&lt;/em&gt; concept. The instructor showed us how to take our pre-soaked rawhides and pull them taught around the wood frames. It was a lot of pulling and folding and manipulating the hide, trying to coax it to conform to the circular shape without too many creases or bumps. Then we added the rawhide strings to the back to keep the tension and create the handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/eTeK6CU7kv65ta7zYxhqSv/email" alt=""&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Back of the drum, showing nine tensioning strings with two wrapped together to form a handle to grasp.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;The animal will tell you about itself,&lt;/q&gt; my instructor said as she wandered through the desks. &lt;q&gt;You can have an idea of what it will be, but ultimately, you have to work with the deer to let it show you what it will become.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the best part of the class: getting yet another culture's perspective of this &lt;em&gt;wu wei&lt;/em&gt; concept. The hide of the deer told me a story: it has scars and bumps and spots that showed through the dye. In a way, the animal still had some say in its transformation from hide to drum. It didn't matter how hard I pulled, there were parts that would not lie perfectly flat or curve the way I wanted. After stringing and tensioning the back, I discovered that the hide had a natural hole on the edge (as opposed to the pre-punched holes from processing), meaning I had nine lines instead of the expected eight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sound of each drum would also be unique, and change over time as the hide settled on the drum and dried. &lt;q&gt;Get to know your drum,&lt;/q&gt; became the instructor's refrain across each class session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, the final product was a collaboration, not a domination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/ke4ebxYD8Wo33nvwJr5Aer/email" alt=""&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Front of the rawhide drum showing the scars that the deer had acquired during its life (all of the thin lines and some of the small dots are scars).
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cyborg&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this may seem to be art-focused, I believe that &lt;em&gt;wu wei&lt;/em&gt; is widely applicable and useful in our lives. Perhaps art is just a training tool to help us practice recognizing the paths set before us and then taking the opportunity to follow where they lead. Not to be confused with &lt;em&gt;inaction&lt;/em&gt;, non-coercive action is an attempt to work with what we have and to honor the agency or the dignity of other creatures and things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a modern context, we might be tempted to see things like a social media feed as following a path—after all, it is constantly providing you with things that are easily followed. This is &lt;em&gt;inaction&lt;/em&gt;, however, because you are not collaborating. Your agency and your &amp;quot;self&amp;quot; are being rushed through a river that is designed to trap you in it. You are the material and the company is the artist that asserts its dominance over you. &lt;em&gt;You will like this content, you will be distracted, you will be harvested for our gain without your true consent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all technology &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be this way. &lt;em&gt;Wu wei&lt;/em&gt; is difficult when our agency is not entirely our own, but it can be practiced, and it can be brought into your circumstance through intention. I believe this helps us flip back into a more agentive role, where we can become actors in our lives again, rather than objects ready to be turned into profits by other agents who do not respect &lt;em&gt;wu wei&lt;/em&gt; or the humanity of others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;em&gt;wu wei&lt;/em&gt; can help us work with others in a non-destructive way. How else can we achieve something within a collection of other agents? When we respect the agency of other people, and even other animals or objects, we allow the art of revelation to work towards a positive outcome. We can still have our own ideas, but we allow each participant to reveal themselves in the process. We will never end up with what a single individual imagined, but that is not a loss; it's an improvement. There are better times ahead when we adapt, update, and move collaboratively. Anything else is ultimately destructive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While splitting up the world in making distinctions within it might seem to have a functional value, it always entails a diminution. The most effective way of cultivating order in the world, invariably relies upon the power of inclusivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Instead, I travelled to an LGBTQIA+ conference to try and explore humanity &amp;quot;in real life&amp;quot; (something that's tough to do for an introvert like myself). I came away with some important themes that I think anyone, regardless of identity, can benefit from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Remember Who You Are&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far from a trite aphorism, this concept seemed to permeate through the speakers and breakout sessions. Particularly in the sense of relationships with others, it's vital to remember who you are, and that you matter. I'm not even close to good at this, as I tend to yield to others' needs or wants, diminish my contribution to conversation, and assume that I don't matter even while affirming that everyone else absolutely does matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that's why this idea seemed to stick out to me, but here are a couple of snippets that I heard:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In response to the question of how to approach someone whose values conflict with yours: Values are different than personhood. If they want to deny you your personhood, that's not a value-based conflict. Remember who you are: you deserve dignity, respect. Removing those things from a person has nothing to do with &amp;quot;values&amp;quot; and everything to do with dehumanizing you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the &amp;quot;yielders&amp;quot;: Dare to say what's on your mind and reveal yourself. That's how you get stronger. Remember that who you are matters; your perspective; your needs; all of you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes it's hard to maintain your sense of self in a relationship. The struggle is remembering: who am I and who are you in our relationship? Failing to remember who you are, even in a very close relationship, like with a spouse, can become unhealthy and ultimately betrays both you and the relationship. (Please speak to a mental health professional to explore more about any of this—not a therapist, here, just a curious writer!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We Are Starved For Love&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lesbian bishop was part of a conversation for one of the sessions. She mentioned that she noticed throughout her ministry that people are starved for love—everyone, not just marginalized groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;We are so miserly with our love,&lt;/q&gt; she emphasized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My tech-sense is tingling, and I wonder how we might find a better balance between our personal relationships and the strange new &amp;quot;tribes&amp;quot; that social media has caused to emerge. Note that I'm using the word &amp;quot;tribe&amp;quot; sarcastically, since that's a term ill-suited for these bizarre identity-based political groups, even though that's how you see it used across the Internet. In fact, I wonder if these false tribes have contributed to the collapse of our in-person relationships and have caused us to hoard our love, preventing it from leaking out to real people in real life. In fact, Dr. Lisa Diamond mentioned this in reference to non-human forms of safety-signaling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;Our brains evolved to get our safety from actual people.&lt;/q&gt; Not signs or flags (or, I would add, AI). You can make your life safer with just one or two connections. This is an act of resistance—the world wants you divided and isolated. Instead, increasing our in-person time with people we are safe to be ourselves with will help us reverse many of the negative effects we're seeing from our isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all starved for love, so let's try to stop hoarding it and instead share it with the people in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trust That I Know Myself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the under-represented groups within the LGBTQIA+ community are the asexual (often shortened to &amp;quot;Ace&amp;quot;) and aromantic (&amp;quot;Aro&amp;quot;) groups. People who identify as Ace don't experience sexual attraction, and those who identify as Aro don't experience romantic attraction. This isn't a tragedy, this isn't a problem to be fixed. This is yet another example of the beautiful diversity of human experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presenter who spoke from this group happened to be both Ace and Aro (somewhat rare). Her remarks had a consistent theme: don't invalidate someone's identity. She has been constantly peppered with questions like, are you sure? Have you just not met the right person? Or receiving comments like, &lt;q&gt;that's so sad I could never imagine not loving someone.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;People don't see my identity as real or valid,&lt;/q&gt; she summarized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking about how a person can have a vastly different experience than my own, it reminds me of how Ed Yong helped readers of his book, &lt;cite&gt;An Immense World&lt;/cite&gt;, get used to the idea of understanding the experience of other animal species:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our umwelt is still limited, it just doesn't &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; that way. To us, it feels all-encompassing. It is all that we know, and so we easily mistake it for all there is &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; know. This is an illusion—and one that every animal shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;aside class="bracket"&gt;
NOTE: &lt;em&gt;umwelt&lt;/em&gt; is a term he uses to refer to the reality a creature inhabits based on its sensory perception—not just its environment, but how it understands and perceives it.
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only do we humans have a broad &lt;em&gt;umwelt&lt;/em&gt;, we also have our own personal &lt;em&gt;umwelts&lt;/em&gt;—based on our senses, our abilities, our experiences, and our identity. With such diversity just within our own species, we can't possibly &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; someone else's experience, but that doesn't mean it isn't real. Our experience may seem complete, all-encompassing, and all there is to know, but that is truly an illusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard enough to &lt;q&gt;know thyself,&lt;/q&gt; how do we ever dare to tell other people who &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; are (or who we think they should be)? Trust that I know myself, and work to know &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;self.&amp;quot; No need to steal that responsibility from someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Human&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sat by myself in my introverted bubble for most of the conference, frequently weeping in silence. It's been quite the year of pain, isolation, and, most of all, feeling terrified that my neighbors might turn into persecutors. The rage and demonization expressed throughout the U.S. presidential campaign and new administration have set fire to my nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To take a break from that and sit in a room with 1,100 other queer people or allies was overwhelming. It was social safety, which, going back to Dr. Diamond again, is when you feel OK &lt;em&gt;as you are&lt;/em&gt; with other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew no one there personally, but tears immediately blinded me just by stepping inside a building where I knew I could be myself: introverted, queer, and everything else in between. There's something special about our humanity, and it's so easy to fade into the background of my day-to-day life. But this was a much-needed reminder that there are still humans out there. There is still community to be had. There is still dignity to be shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You matter. I matter.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>The Shadow of Humanity</title><link>http://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/the-shadow-of-humanity/</link><description>&amp;quot;Dad!&amp;quot; I yell with exasperation. &amp;quot;Can you come take a look at this?&amp;quot;

&lt;p&gt;Something spins on my computer screen, error codes displayed on a box. I click randomly to no avail, but suddenly the screen refreshes, the error is gone, and everything works perfectly. I spin around to find my dad has entered the room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh sure, now it's working! Just 'cause you're here,&amp;quot; I say. He chuckles and retreats the way he came. &lt;em&gt;Computers really like him,&lt;/em&gt; I think, as I continue on tinkering with whatever's on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moments later, I might get called down by my mom to help her with some computer issue, only to have the exact same thing happen—everything is broken until I come to look, then the computer decides to shape up and act as though nothing had happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe computers do enjoy the gaslighting, but long-time readers of CYBORG_ know that my personal stance on anthropomorphizing machines is a dangerous distraction, and probably has more to do with &lt;a href="/newsletters/the-problem-we-are-avoiding-with-ai/"&gt;our brain's evolution&lt;/a&gt; than these systems having an actual &amp;quot;being&amp;quot; or consciousness. However, there is something that happens when the fingerprints of humanity are left on our machines, and that might bring out some surprising behavior from the cold, stoic technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shadows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know about you, but when I think about technology, I think of it in terms of stability, facts. It's unfeeling, unbiased, unemotional. It's something reliable. 1+1=2, no matter how many times you punch it into the calculator. If you get the wrong answer, it's because you, the human, messed up—garbage in, garbage out after all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is it, then, that we're seeing really good evidence that artificial intelligence has &lt;a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/news/covert-racism-ai-how-language-models-are-reinforcing-outdated-stereotypes"&gt;racial biases&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/full-gender-shades-thesis-17/"&gt;Gender biases&lt;/a&gt;? If AI really is just another tool, why is it falling for the same old fallacies, stereotypes, and prejudices that we humans have? Does this not demonstrate a kind of consciousness? Or maybe it means that the human creators were pulling the wrong levers—passing their personal biases onto their creation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there is more to it than simply pointing at the creators and saying they just hard-coded some problematic stuff into it (not that they don't have serious responsibility for what they &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; done, bad intentions or not). I also do not think this is actually unique to AI alone. Potentially, these biases have accompanied our tech for far longer than we've realized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this observation by Jun'ichirō Tanizaki:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese music is, above all, a music of reticence, of atmosphere. When recorded or amplified...the greater part of its charm is lost...Most important of all are the pauses. Yet [the recordings] render these moments of silence utterly lifeless. And so we distort the arts themselves to curry favor for them with the machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a guess when this was written. 2000? 1990? Maybe 1970? Nope. He wrote this in his essay, &lt;cite&gt;In Praise of Shadows,&lt;/cite&gt; back in 1933. Even more profound were the musings on technology and culture. Tanizaki mourns the losses felt in Eastern culture as Western technology was invading: photography, radio, trolleys, airplanes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He notes that, left alone, the East may have continued to develop slowly—at their own pace—but that they &lt;q&gt;would have gone only in a direction that suited us.&lt;/q&gt; The technology would have been developed in support of their values, their complexions, their landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;They would have been no borrowed gadgets, they would have been the tools of our own culture, suited to us.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, this was a paradigm shift. Suddenly, I can see how technology is not some set-apart thing. It absolutely does have bias, opinion, stereotypes, built in. Not necessarily due to ill-intent or some grand attempt at large-scale oppression (though that's &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; possible). But technology is inescapably linked to culture and the values of that culture will therefore permeate the tech for better or worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not because the technology is alive or conscious or self-aware. It is because technology is the shadow of humanity. We build it after our likeness, and it reflects that shaping back to us—recognizable if we decide to look at the shadow, but just as easily slipping into the environment as a subtle, unimposing thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shadows can create beauty as Tanizaki argues in his essay, but they can also hide dangers. Perhaps especially for Westerners, shadows are uncomfortable. Maybe we're afraid of seeing what we've built into the darkness. If you can bear to look at the shadow, the question becomes: what do you see?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Drawing on Memory</title><link>http://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/drawing-on-memory/</link><description>&amp;quot;It's remarkable what details the students end up putting in their sketches.

They'll get the right number of windows or some other feature without trying to...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was drawing a window that caught my eye in Switzerland and overheard my professor talking to the other chaperones. I tried to ignore it, but I couldn't help feeling the stares as I sat on the ground sketching while everyone else was waiting for our train. The spotlight effect made me wonder if my professor had been talking about me, because, as I realized, my little sketch was actually pretty accurate to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/rnE91HLLfKdWrkyLwH5Nai/email" alt=""&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Sketch of a Swiss window
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, I doubt that they were able to see me at work in my sketchbook right then, but that little conversation stuck with me, and a curiosity has emerged over the past 14 years that I've been back from my study abroad: How &lt;em&gt;powerful&lt;/em&gt; is drawing? What's the point of drawing if you're not an artist? Does drawing matter anymore?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish that drawing was not so intimidating to people. I've been more comfortable with it than most, because I've had years of interest and training in mark-making, drawing, and fine arts. But the vast majority of people I've talked to immediately shun their drawing skills—laughing at the idea of drawing, saying they can't draw a stick-figure, or claiming that they just don't have the talent for it as though drawing is a special gift bestowed on the prodigious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great loss, especially as technology and AI are smothering our senses and are effectively becoming our environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Presence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who likes to create videos, I'm frequently torn as I consider taking video or enjoying the moment—especially if I have gone somewhere unique. It's not just wanna-be YouTubers like myself, you see people with their camera apps on their phones at any event, anywhere you go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/7N5SqQhpqV18bpXeJNKM61/email" alt=""&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cropped photo of a crowd with phones recording video by &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/@adityachinchure?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=unsplash"&gt;Aditya Chinchure&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/group-of-people-in-front-of-stage-ZhQCZjr9fHo?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=unsplash"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrasted with my experience in Switzerland where I didn't even have a phone let alone a phone with video capability, I have wondered if I have lost something. During my program in Europe, I only had my sketchbook. I wasn't able to capture much of the stunning visual environment that is Switzerland, and the sketches don't compare to what I know classmates have: beautiful photographs and videos taken with telephoto lenses. And yet, the sketches I do have are also much more meaningful to me and have somehow captured more of the story than a photo typically does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That one small sketch of a random window encoded the overheard conversation my professor was having behind me. Every time I look at that drawing, I think of what I heard while drawing; how the cloudless sky allowed the sunlight to drape over me with perfect warmth; how the concrete felt on my calves as I sat cross-legged, cradling my sketchbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's something about drawing that gets all of my senses involved. It's a slower process, and like my professor pointed out in the rest of his observation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It forces them to really look at the thing. Even if you've seen it before, when you draw it, you are noticing the details. It's like you're seeing it for the first time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's not to disparage the art of photography or videography (I think you can be just as intentional, present, and aware with those art forms), but snapping some quick photos or selfies or random panning videos is not the same as composing, planning, and executing a shot. When I've gone to a new place or an event, I feel pressure to take a quick snap, almost like it proves I was there. I feel compelled to remember the experience because it's so unique. Ironically, the uniqueness is already what will help me remember, but the random photos collected into a vast archive on the cloud is distracting me from engraving the moment in my memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While photographs can help us remember—no doubt about that—they also seem to take us out of the moment. At least in my experience, capturing snapshots puts me in a disembodied state. I'm viewing the experience through my phone's screen instead of through my own eyes. Drawing forces me to be extremely present, because I'm very focused on one thing, appreciating the shape or line or movement and distilling the information down into something that represents it on paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Utility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefits of drawing aren't restricted to capturing memories, especially if drawing from life isn't something you've practiced. I think that drawing may well be critical to surviving the digital age. The utility of a drawing isn't just the end-product, and the image is usually less valuable overall anyway. I think the real usefulness is in the process of clarifying your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are endless apps—and now AI—that can help you create &amp;quot;polished&amp;quot; images, charts, and graphs, but just like taking out your phone for a random snapshot, these really aren't &lt;em&gt;useful&lt;/em&gt; if they aren't helping you understand your own thoughts. Drawing is the low-cost, low-tech, accessible method to quickly move something from your mind to paper. And once it's on paper, you can work with it further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I'm trying to code some new system, I reach for a pen more often than not. A quick sketch of my idea is immensely helpful to validate the plan in my mind—or to recognize issues I didn't notice before. These are not beautiful sketches. They're ugly boxes with arrows, messed up lines, and a few words that are barely readable. These aren't precious; I throw these away (delete them, since I often turn to my tablet for these kinds of single-use drawings).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Plan for a form including input types and notes about functionality.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What weighs on my mind is a future where we have wholly dismissed drawing as a tool and treating it as a product instead. If the sole purpose of drawing is the image at the end, then it will be boiled down to some easily reproducible, ubiquitous, and meaningless repetition of stale ideas. Basically, we'll get AI-generated imagery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where factories and AI both tend toward the average, we can go back to this ancient tool. Drawing is one of the most fundamental forms of communication and the more I do it, the more I'm convinced of how effective it really is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just last week, I had a completely new experience with drawing. An art therapist was invited to lead a group session at work, and I was surprised to discover yet another way that drawing could be powerful. I came to the session ready to put away my artistic training, because I wanted to understand how art therapy might work if I had no theories and techniques swirling in my mind while drawing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start us off, she provided a prompt of an emotional state (fear, acceptance, anticipation, etc.) and we had one minute to draw out that representation. We went through eight of these prompts, and my approach was to really try and access a childlike mindset: making quick decisions (not analyzing or planning too much), drawing by feeling rather than by intellect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/37H39nKB4BU7bFwqaWqCfV/email" alt=""&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Emotion states drawn quickly with oil pastel.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result surprised me. The first thing I noticed was that &amp;quot;joy&amp;quot; was an emotional state that doesn't feel well developed to me (that's the one represented by the single green circle). It is a state I have been in much less frequently throughout my life and is very difficult for me to capture. This translates to other artistic expressions—I'm not just basing this on the exercise above—since I have routinely struggled to create art or write music that is about joy or happiness. The unpleasant emotions are much easier for me to access, and to me, this simple exercise helped underscore that aspect of my emotional life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were many other insights I pulled out of this, like how my recent health concerns are occupying my mind and how fear and anger are so interconnected to me. The most interesting to me is how applicable this simple act of drawing can be in any part of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven't drawn something in a while—try it again. Find a scrap of paper in the trash, go to a corner where no one can see you, and scribble out that thing that's been on your mind. Hide it or share it—whichever helps you keep the confidence to do it again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of drawing isn't always creating a beautiful thing. Sometimes the goal is to do the opposite: create an ugly thing. Even more impactful is a goal to clarify or reveal your thoughts and feelings. Drawing doesn't need to be life-like, colorful, or clean to be powerful. It just needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>How Do You Recognize a Merism?</title><link>http://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/how-do-you-recognize-a-merism/</link><description>I stepped over a few boards and navigated around the maze of construction materials.

There was a light on in the back half of the warehouse where we found a few chairs to sit on. It was a freezing cold evening in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, and I had come to this odd place to meet my wife's friend, a respected scholar and writer in the LDS community. We had chosen this location because we could meet with relatively low risk without putting masks on, but the space ultimately represents what I learned in conversation there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We meandered through lots of fascinating topics as we chatted, when eventually she taught me a new word: merism. She was referring to a verse in the Book of Mormon that contained this &amp;quot;merism&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;...he inviteth them all...black and white, bond and free, male and female;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
2 Nephi 26:33
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A merism is a way to emphasize a reference to &amp;quot;everything,&amp;quot; by highlighting two extremes within that &amp;quot;everything.&amp;quot; For example, in college, I would work &lt;em&gt;day and night&lt;/em&gt; on print-making projects. This implies that I was doing those kinds of projects all the time—even though in this case, it's hyperbole, since I certainly did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; work on &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; continuously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, this little rhetorical device has the potential to open up spaces where we might not have seen space before. Even though a merism is usually about identifying binaries, I've found more gradients as I've paused and looked at them more closely. So, in honor of Pride month, let's take a look at the stuff in the &amp;quot;in-between.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/v5rRSXDTm2GmEe8Zf82k3a/email" alt=""&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;"All of this is gray" indicating the largest portion of a gradient between the color white and the color black.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Many merisms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the scripture reference mentioned above, we see three sets of these merisms: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;black and white&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bond and free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;male and female&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first set is referring to race as a concept of skin color. Bad theology and racism of the Church and/or contributors to the text aside, the text itself is attempting to present the idea that your race (a.k.a. your skin color) has no effect on God's invitation to come to Him. This merism presents us with our first opportunity to break out of binary thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think they are &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to do this, but what if we took a moment each time we recognize a merism and considered what is in between the two highlighted things? Who might be forgotten in our shortcut of saying &amp;quot;black and white&amp;quot;? If it's hard to identify someone or something else in between the two endpoints, that's our cue to look for more diverse voices, concepts, and stories. (If you want a great book on race in the U.S., you might consider &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=so+you+want+to+talk+about+race&amp;amp;oq=so+you+want+to"&gt;So You Want to Talk About Race&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt; by Ijeoma Oluo)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bond and free can also be a merism, because at least from my view, there is a gradient of experiences between bondage and freedom. Some people are in bondage even while technically being free, such as those whom the United States (and many other places) intentionally and systematically oppress. There are all kinds of bondage: from addiction to debt to disability. There are all kinds of freedoms: from having rights to having privilege or wealth or time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, our merism highlights extremes, but provides us the chance to fill in the blanks, practice empathy, and consider alternate view points. An excellent resource to explore bondage and freedom is &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="https://newjimcrow.com/"&gt;The New Jim Crow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt; by Michelle Alexander (in the context of the U.S., though it may have implications in other places).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, we have our gender merism: male and female. Are there only two genders—or two sexes? The context here might say no—not because the author's intent was to imply a spectrum, it almost certainly wasn't possible for the author to conceive of that, given the historical context. Rather, it's an opportunity to consider making space since we now know so much more about humanity's diverse experience with gender and the varying presentation of biological sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point here is that if we're going to treat the first two sets as gradients, we can do the same for the last set since the precedent is already there. Maybe it's a way to start opening up doors that used to be slammed shut by ignorance and fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to explore the gender merism in a more Christian context, I highly recommend the book &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="https://austenhartke.com/book"&gt;Transforming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt; by Austen Hartke. He does an excellent job of examining theological perspectives, biblical examples, and contemporary stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In sickness and in health&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own body has taught me about this merism. Multiple sclerosis (MS) has shown me that the lines between &amp;quot;sick&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;healthy&amp;quot; can be quite blurry. MS impacts me every day, even when I'm feeling great, because it takes the reasonable predictability out of my grasp. Some days, when I feel really good, I push myself too hard and I end up crashing in the afternoon. Other times I know the whole day is just bad. And that's nowhere near the extreme end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I had my first (and so far, only) MS attack, I was so overwhelmed with grief. My body had lost everything I loved: coordination, energy, and clear thinking. It completely changed my scale of experience with health and sickness. Suddenly I knew things can get much, much worse—and I was never going to be quite as well as I had been before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/o4sNHpQ1sJkSwnYbD46tZg/email" alt=""&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Before MS and after MS, my scale of health and sickness drastically changed.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my immaturity prior to my diagnosis, I often found myself being quite judgmental of people around me. I often classified people as lazy or weak if they had a difficult time waking up in the morning, or if they tired out more quickly than I did, or if they complained for any reason about a task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My MS attack sharply humbled me and opened my eyes to the massively diverse experiences possible in the context of health and stamina. This was a merism with a vast middle range that I could no longer escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life experience is what helps us to break out of the constricting binaries that we're surrounded with. Even recognizing that your experience and your reality is different than everyone else's is a helpful practice to stay curious and to see past assumptions or stereotypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CYBORG&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use merisms to emphasize inclusivity, but it's up to us to draw out what's in between. It can be a trap for us to stay in a binary mindset, where things are easily classified as &amp;quot;black&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;white.&amp;quot; It's on us to decide to use this shortcut as a reminder instead of a reinforcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is particularly potent as we continue to be drawn to our technological echo-chambers. Social media and other AI or algorithmically supported content feeds can and do make us feel connected and validated, since we're served pieces that we already agree with. That's why I think we have to find our own &amp;quot;technology&amp;quot; to remind us that there is a lot more nuance out there than what we see all day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it's something we should celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've found it is easier to access my own humanity when I open up to more diverse ideas and listen to the experiences of others. It may not be practical to name everything in a gradient, but it's worth focusing on the under-represented and elevating their voices and experiences wherever you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, merisms are about making larger spaces between two extremes. Life is complex, humans are complex, and there's more than enough room for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Resistance is futile...and humanity</title><link>http://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/resistance-is-futile-and-humanity/</link><description>What's the Point?

&lt;p&gt;I have Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and that has revealed a challenge that I can barely wrap my mind around: How do you deal with uncertainty? MS is nicknamed the snowflake disease, because it can affect people in wildly different ways. My experience with MS has been relatively mild, but with major ups and downs, as well as an over-arching threat of great disability in my future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Maintain hope for good things&amp;quot; was a common message that others gave to me when I was first diagnosed. I sneered at the platitude internally. &lt;em&gt;How dare you assume there's something good that I can ever experience now? Don't talk to me about hope. Hope is for fools.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I was both right and wrong. It's a paradox: how do you continue living today, when you have no guarantees of tomorrow? As it turns out, this isn't a problem just for people with MS—it is the human problem. Everyone has to grapple with this at some point. No one is guaranteed a &amp;quot;tomorrow,&amp;quot; because there is no way to avoid pain or death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although no one is exempt, I think it's easier to push off this paradox almost like a survivorship bias. When I'm healthy and feeling good, I don't put any thought to it, because I live my days in a long, unbroken chain. The past makes the future seem predictable: wake up, exercise, go to work, watch &lt;cite&gt;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&lt;/cite&gt;, fall asleep, repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, however, I was hit with something that broke my chain. I've only had two migraines in my whole life until last week when I had three: Saturday, Thursday, and Friday. After two migraines, I was worried—&lt;em&gt;is this a pattern? Did I just push past recovery too fast?&lt;/em&gt; Once the third one hit, the fear really sunk in: &lt;em&gt;Is there something wrong with my brain? Has MS progressed more than I know? Is this something to expect more of in the future?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At times like these, when uncertainty slaps my face, the paradox comes into full view. What is the point of continuing on, when there is great risk of suffering in the future? Why not end it now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Humanity is Resistance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the overwhelming circumstances we're facing today from technology to politics, everything seems like it is outside our reach of influence. Everything feels futile—pointless and ineffective, unchangeable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I receive responses from my messages to senators or when I see what my country's current administration is doing, I find myself clawing through the muck in search of humanity. It can't be gone, can it? What can I even do? I'm one person against a machine; insignificant, disposable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's a bug or maybe it's a feature, but humans seem to be pretty obstinate when we want to be. Personal experience has shown me that toddlers learn and latch onto the word, &amp;quot;no,&amp;quot; quicker than almost any other—and proudly overuse their proclamation of resistance. High school history seemed to highlight oppressors and the resistance with figures like Mahatma Ghandi, Rosa Parks, or the &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank_Man"&gt;Tank Man&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's something about resistance that is deeply moving (ironically). I've been staring at the &lt;a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/dd/Tank_Man_%28Tiananmen_Square_protester%29.jpg"&gt;famous photo of the &amp;quot;Tank Man&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; and I feel simultaneously terrified and inspired. The fact that a single person could stop a line of tanks leaving Tiananmen Square in Beijing, China is stunning. As far as I know, we have no clue who the man is/was. Was it a normal day up until he saw the chance to literally take a stand? Was he actively looking for the opportunity over weeks and months, or was this spontaneous given the circumstance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there are two principles that can help us in our paradox of dealing with overwhelming systems and grave uncertainty:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You only have today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be a Zimbardo hero&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Divination&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like we've been conditioned to look into the future more than is healthy or necessary. Our species is a planning species—we can see pretty far into the distance, and that increases the time we have to anticipate things that are coming or happening. That extra time allows us to make plans in anticipation of what we see coming. Technology helps us take this &amp;quot;foresight&amp;quot; from our natural eyes into a mystical realm. We can rely rather well on predictions about the weather, not just for today, but sometimes for an entire week. AI uses its predictions to surface content we'll probably like and engage with on social media. FBI profilers try to identify threats before they happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some of those things may be helpful or even crucial, I wonder if, individually, this expectation of seeing into the future is quite damaging? In terms of my health, MS is pretty unpredictable—I don't know whether I'll have a good day or a bad day, I don't know whether these &lt;a href="/newsletters/partner-in-creation/"&gt;random, peripheral symptoms&lt;/a&gt; are a part of MS or if they're just a manifestation of stress on my MS-weakened body. It's actually been a huge mental health struggle for me as I consider what my future could be like. Every time a new symptom comes or a bad day arises, I feel trapped and squeezed, like the walls are pressing in around me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paradox is the isometric exercise of the mind. We want to see tomorrow, but we only have today. Is it possible to put the perspective of our lives in a better balance with time? The paradox is that you need to have direction (a &amp;quot;vision&amp;quot; of the future) in order for the day to be effective in helping to get you there. A year full of days with random actions will not get you where you want to go, but trying to see the future is an illusion that could also derail your path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/f9VF4UegViGZjo5yxpN2Ny/email" alt=""&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Random actions compared with directed actions.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal approach has been to shorten my view into the future—looking only a few days ahead if at all—and to abandon a sense of &amp;quot;destination.&amp;quot; Instead of having a goal that must be achieved in the future, I try to focus on values and compounds (I'm using this word in reference to the &lt;em&gt;compound effect&lt;/em&gt;). Values are about who I want to be. Compounds are what I see growing behind me in retrospect: like seeing how CYBORG_ articles continue to be published, or other projects get completed, or emails get sent to senators. It's my body of work (or at least the artifacts of that work). That centers me pretty well on &lt;em&gt;today.&lt;/em&gt; I don't know what effect I can have on the world (if any). I'm not planning some grand thing to be accomplished. Instead, every day that is a good day is a chance for me to live my values and work on my work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a kind of resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resisting the pressures of others' expectations. Resisting the idea that my life is meaningless—because I'm doing what I believe is right and I'm working on what matters to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You, too, only have today—anything else is memory or possibility. What you do with all of the &amp;quot;todays&amp;quot; will pile up into something that you can examine after-the-fact. And this isn't just a fluffy cop-out: 10 days of effort put into your values and your personal priorities for action adds up. 100 days of it becomes self-advancing. 1,000 days of it becomes impressive. 10,000 days becomes monumental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Zimbardo Hero&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phillip Zimbardo was the infamous psychologist behind the &lt;em&gt;Stanford Prison Experiment,&lt;/em&gt; in which participating students were randomly assigned to be either a prisoner or a guard. As Zimbardo recounts in the phenomenal book, &lt;em&gt;The Lucifer Effect,&lt;/em&gt; the experiment quickly deteriorates into a disturbing, life-like experience of brutality and torture. The thing that struck me the most was how Zimbardo did not take away a grim view of humanity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen years ago, I recall watching a video where Zimbardo explained that a hero is someone who does something that anyone &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do, but that not everyone &lt;em&gt;does.&lt;/em&gt; That was all I needed to hear to construct a new idea—a value—to work towards. I wanted to be a &amp;quot;Zimbardo hero.&amp;quot; It's not about doing some superhuman act. It's not about visibility or grand spectacles. It's about taking action when the need arises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can do that. We can choose to disconnect from our routine to help someone. We can take action in democracy (or whatever means you have available) to oppose inhumane and dangerous legislation. We can tell our boss that something is unethical. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;Tank Man&amp;quot; is a Zimbardo hero to me. It wasn't much in terms of actions taken. But it did change the world—here I am talking about it almost exactly 36 years after it happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zimbardo's work throughout his life was all about how the &lt;em&gt;situation&lt;/em&gt; can affect whether we'll do good or evil. The same situation can &amp;quot;inflame the hostile imagination in those who become perpetrators of evil&amp;quot; but can also &amp;quot;inspire the heroic imagination in others or render most people passive bystanders and guilty of the evil of inaction.&amp;quot; (&lt;a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/philip_zimbardo_the_psychology_of_evil?language=en"&gt;TEDTalk, The psychology of evil&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Zimbardo hero acts when others don't. The Zimbardo hero is focused on others, not themselves, so that when the situation arises, they can and will act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alchemy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of focusing on today and understanding that everyone—including you—can be a Zimbardo hero is how we can move forward. Yes, we are so much weaker alone—but that's the illusion we should resist. We're not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That isn't dismissing the reality and the deep pain of the loneliness that many of us feel. It is sometimes just so hard to see who is with you; really with you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humanity is resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's how we stop oppression. That's how we make it through another difficult day of health challenges. That's how we continue on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It hurts. It's scary. It's also contagious. Your heroism inspires more heroism. Your stand moves others to their feet. Your arm of support reaches farther than you know.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
