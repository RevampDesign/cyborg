I'm gripping a cold plastic handle, finger resting immediately on a trigger. My sister is wrapped up in a huge blanket and we're both surrounded with pillows. Choral music begins to play from the surround-sound speakers and the huge screen in front of us displays the logo that first showed me how cool typography (specifically custom type) could be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Halo: Combat Evolved&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a silly thing, but it's one of my favorite experiences growing up. Playing this intense alien-shooter game in our parents' super scary basement with my best friend is about the most nostalgic thing I can think of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly enough, this game has a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; to do with themes we've been exploring in CYBORG_ recently: horror, &lt;a href="https://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/the-deadly-65th-floor-dinner-party/"&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Alien&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (the movie franchise), &lt;a href="https://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/the-most-subtle-ai-movie-ever/"&gt;religion + technology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/the-apocalypse-is-here/"&gt;monstrosity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/do-you-ever-feel-like-you-are-being-watched/"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; (AI), and &lt;a href="https://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/the-artist-as-enemy-part-one/"&gt;art&lt;/a&gt;. The game bleeds into our reality, not just through concepts and ideas, but the central AI character, Cortana, was the design inspiration for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortana_(virtual_assistant)"&gt;Microsoft's personal assistant&lt;/a&gt; (2009-2023) and in my opinion a &lt;em&gt;fantastic&lt;/em&gt; marketing ploy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secure your suits and load your ammo, this is gonna go deep...space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nihilism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a game with such in-your-face Christian names (Halo, The Covenant, The Flood, Master Chief), the actual feeling is an almost nihilistic, empty hopelessness. This is perhaps a poetic reflection of outer space itself, which is the setting of the game. While the &amp;quot;last frontier&amp;quot; is beautiful, inspiring, and full of potential, it also holds deeply disturbing horrors. I'm talking about actual horrors: being stranded in space is probably the most helpless you could possibly be. Then of course, we can thank imaginative horrors like the &lt;cite&gt;Alien&lt;/cite&gt; franchise to fill in the potential things to be found in the vast, real universe. Who knows if there are other life forms—or diseases—out there that could interrupt or discontinue our current reality if found and brought to earth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game pops us right into the middle of some kind of galactic struggle. We're awakened from a cryogenic sleep in response to our ship being boarded by the hostile multi-species alien alliance called The Covenant. At first, there's not much that we know besides, &amp;quot;Me have gun, they have gun, start shooting.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The religious themes start to develop even further as we start putting together the larger story pieces. There's a whole history of an ideological conflict between two ancient species that ends up producing the conflict we're engaged in: The Forerunners vs. The Flood. The Covenant believe they are the successors to the Forerunners (who are now extinct), and have fanatically taken up &amp;quot;The Mantle&amp;quot; to be the caretakers of the universe. But to understand any of this, we first have to make it to the ring-world, Halo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Whoever controls Halo controls the fate of the universe,&amp;quot; Cortana, our AI companion, informs us. We are led to believe that Halo is simply a weapon that the Covenant plan to use against humans. Not so! Halo is actually a fail-safe that will eradicate all sentient life in the worst-case scenario that The Flood (another alien force) get loose. The Covenant aliens are prepared to sacrifice all lives—theirs, ours, and almost everything else—in order to starve the Flood into extinction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's where this gets interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Flood is a zombie-like force—technically separate entities, but also controlled and connected as if it were one organism. We first see the Flood emerge when the game goes from fun alien-shooter to horror-survival–shooter. Tons of little aliens start to swarm and when they find corpses of any kind or other temporarily live characters, they infect the bodies and turn them into grotesque zombies that then attack you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This surprise mid-way through the game introduces the nihilism that pervades the lore. It's no longer just aliens vs. humans, because the Flood is voracious and makes no distinction between food options. There are times throughout the game series that humans team up with Covenant forces against the Flood. Ultimately, it feels hopeless and pointless, because the Flood just keeps coming. They multiply with every fallen soldier and sometimes reanimate their own corpses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a true &lt;a href="https://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/the-apocalypse-is-here/"&gt;Romero-style zombie&lt;/a&gt; in which you are forced to face an ever-growing crowd. Individuals may not be hard to get rid of, but the true power comes in the masses. The Flood is the perfect name for this force—unstoppable, uncontrollable, and continuously expanding—and of course it pulls in more Biblical references. The Flood is destruction, and except for some ancient speculative technologies, there is no deliverance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trapped in a war with forces greater than any individual, history longer than generations, and never-ending swarms of foes, every bit of meaning eventually falls away and survival takes the place of any other concerns. This aspect of the game feels like our current political situation in the U.S.: decisions, fanaticism, and ideologies that are larger than just you or me are playing out a conflict that we both do and do not impact. The social and political systems continue on as if they are cosmic beings clashing and destroying parts of our realities at different times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Limbo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I brushed up on the lore for Halo, I realized something about the game's environmental design that was validated in a video about &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_TTXYOC8SE"&gt;why Halo is so creepy&lt;/a&gt;: it's full of liminal spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;An empty room filtering into a shorter hallway in a brutalist-style concrete environment.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We end up exploring various environments that are devoid of life aside from the Covenant or Flood. Technically even the plant life in the &amp;quot;outside&amp;quot; areas of the Halo ring-world is contrived. The whole world is constructed, not necessarily natural. Then when we explore the deep architecture beneath the surface, we find ourselves in spaces that can feel very tight, or extremely vast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/2HnWiKEjec1re242t6yhdB/email" alt=""&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;More concrete-like walls and floors, but this hallway is eerily tall.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Liminal spaces&amp;quot; here includes a sense of dread that is felt in spaces that are &amp;quot;in-between.&amp;quot; In a way, this is the &amp;quot;monstrous&amp;quot; side of architecture. Humans tend to consider other humans or things that break categories as monsters. Zombies, for example, are human, but also not human. They're alive even though they're supposed to be dead. Same with liminal spaces. Those spooky hallways in hotels or the dark and stuffy stairwells that take you to a parking lot are spaces that exist as connections, not destinations. They're places, but they're uncomfortable—especially when they're empty, no one around but you (as far as you can tell).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halo uses these liminal space environments to great effect. Tight interconnected and repeating hallways increase the dread as you take every turn just waiting for the jump scare you know is going to show at some point. Vast spaces don't remove the dread either, because they can suddenly fill with the Flood, chasing you down as if in a nightmare where you run and run, but respite is always still farther ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Ultimate Betrayal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While trying to work out what's going on, kill enemies, and save your own skin, there's one aspect of the story that has been subtly hiding in plain sight. AI has been a part of our journey every step of the way (literally, since Cortana gets ported into our helmet and speaks to us intermittently as we play). Halfway through the game (at the same time we start learning about the Flood), we get separated from Cortana as she gets put into the Halo Control Center and alerts us to go save some fellow humans. That's where we meet 343 Guilty Spark (I'll call him the Monitor from here on out). The Monitor is an AI housed in a box-like case that can float and teleport. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole game to this point, we have been given no hint that AI can't be trusted. So when the Monitor tells us how to activate Halo's defenses to stop the Flood, we go right along with it. Just as we are about to activate the literal kill-switch, Cortana re-emerges from the control center terminal and stops us, revealing the truth of what we were about to do. Finally, the Monitor admits the consequences of its instructions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Technically this installation pulse has a maximum effective radius of 25,000 lightyears but once the others follow suit, this galaxy will be quite devoid of life—or at least any life with sufficient biomass to sustain the Flood, but you already knew that. I mean, how couldn't you?...We have followed outbreak containment procedure to the letter. You were with me each step of the way as we managed this crisis.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially understood as a benign guardian of the ancient technology of Halo, the Monitor has been revealed as having less-than-transparent motives at best, at worst it is a maniacal AI bent on destroying all sentient life (and it proceeds to try and kill you for the rest of the game, so...).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Flood was the first big surprise of this game, and this sudden betrayal was the second. The game was released in 2001, so from my experience of feeling like computers were trustworthy machines that would guide humanity to all things good, having an AI antagonist was deeply disconcerting. However, this clearly reflects realities that are now playing out in real-world AI. Motivations may not be the right word, but incentives certainly apply to the behavior of AI models. Incentives are driving the development of the models (felt by the companies creating them) and incentives drive the models' output (the more you engage is likely the &amp;quot;reward&amp;quot; that an AI model is seeking).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI is not an impartial arbiter of truth and goodness. Not in the game, not in real life, and hopefully not ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way, the artificial intelligences in the game feel like manifestations of that original ancient conflict: The Forerunner alien civilization with its own priorities and values against human civilization with our priorities and values. Cortana is a hero in her own right throughout the game series and even tugs on heartstrings as you develop a relationship with her. The Monitor with its agenda manipulates us and hinders our progress. Even now, it's tough for me to refer to Cortana as an &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; instead of a &amp;quot;her,&amp;quot; demonstrating how much of a relationship we developed, even knowing it's a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seemingly innocent themes of our relationship to/with AI in these games is uncomfortable to me now that our current reality has given us these very opportunities. So, in a way, Halo has taught me an important lesson about AI: trust must be earned, but it is a fragile thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In real life, my current opinion is to avoid any possibility of forming a &amp;quot;relationship&amp;quot; with AI. The risks are not even close to the possible benefits. AI is ultimately a manifestation of its creator's context—it inherits traits, biases, and agendas as a result of its creation, and that alone is enough to dissuade me from putting any kind of real trust in it. If a company is incentivized (as they currently all are) to maximize our engagement with their AI models, it doesn't matter how friendly, how heroic and Cortana-like the model appears, it simply cannot have your best interest &amp;quot;at heart&amp;quot; because it is trying to keep you in relationship to itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have not yet created Cortanas, all we have at present are Monitors—friendly faces on black boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cyborg&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This nostalgic game turned out to be much deeper than I thought. It explores so much of how technology impacts our actual lives. Something as simple as the design of a building can impact our mood or our feeling of safety, as we saw in the liminal spaces exploiting our dread in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing about the Christian-religious themes throughout the game is that humans aren't really a part of it, aside from your character acting as a savior figure. You could map the idea of a cosmic struggle between good and evil onto the Forerunner/Covenant vs. Flood conflict...and yet, humans just get in the way in the minds of the Covenant. Is it really good vs. evil? When you can't see yourself in a religious mythology, it changes everything. Although The Flood pose an actual threat to all life, does the religious story imposed on the threat &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; justify the violent genocide and suicide?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI pulling the strings as an over-arching plot device is another aspect that reaches deeply into our fears. Apparently having a &amp;quot;human in the loop,&amp;quot; simply isn't enough if AI can avoid being transparent about its guidance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are as easily manipulated by machines as we are by ideologies and religious fanaticism. When misunderstandings are codified into religious rites and traditions, it becomes very difficult to sort out what is true and what is moral. We see this bleeding into the rhetoric and opinions about our technology in the real world (I would include politics as a part of that &amp;quot;technology&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...the aliens see the Forerunners as gods, and fancy themselves to be their successors. Since the Forerunners were able to build the Halo installations, it is safe to assume they were a highly advanced species. The fact that the Covenant holds the technology left behind by this ancient civilisation to be sacred might mean that it is in fact technology itself they are worshipping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world full of paradoxes, it's important to continuously check in with yourself: what are my values? Am I living in harmony with those values? How can I work to see the humanity in those around me—especially those who are in-between or don't fit my preferred categories of human?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of raising our blasters against monsters, we should look for ways to dismantle the desire to demonize found within ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>The Systems of Nightmares</title><link>http://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/the-systems-of-nightmares/</link><description>In the familiar house of an old ranching property I've visited for more than a quarter-century, I felt that something was off.

My hackles were raised and I sensed an intense danger. I ran into a room and slammed the heavy door shut. I know this door: it's tricky to lock, so I examined the crack between door and frame, lifting the bottom slightly so that I can see the mechanics as they click into place. Deadbolt slides smoothly, and I take my first deep breath. The handle shakes violently and the door shudders as someone throws themselves at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know who's on the other side. It's a balding, middle-aged man. The remaining thin hair splashes across his head and around his temples, reflecting his own unpredictable, intemperate behavior. He's dangerous and he wants to kill me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I back away from the door and wince as the old wood floor creaks. He still fiddles with the doorknob, but it's getting quieter. A chill sneaks through my nervous system when I realize what room I'm in: the mudroom / sunroom that connects to the garage. That means there's another door I've neglected. I turn around and sneak over to that door, locking and pulling the chain up and into its slot. Now I can breathe this time. I'm safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning back to the original door, I take a few quiet steps. It's not quiet enough now that the doorknob has been still—I hadn't noticed the silence in my panic to secure the back door. My eyes lock onto the dull, wide-eyed gaze of the man from under the crack. He had laid down on the floor and watched me this whole time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panic creeps back in. The space between the floor and the bottom of the door grows larger until I can see his whole face. He can fit under the door—and he smiles wide as I realize this. I have a heavy blue and white vase in my hands and I prepare to slam it on his head as he crawls toward me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Are you ok?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wake up completely confused and scared. I don't trust what I am seeing. It seems to be my room as I left it last night—but I was just in a room that felt familiar and correct, despite it being completely incorrect to reality's architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to calm myself and detangle reality from imagination, I get one last total-body chill of fear despite being in actual safety. The mere memory of my dream taking its final toll for my nighttime travels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nightmare Science?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nightmares such as the one I described above have haunted me for the last few years—not necessarily in frequency, but in intensity. Prior to the 2020 pandemic, I don't recall very many times where I would remember my dreams at all, let alone be awoken whimpering in fear or fighting for my life to escape from some terrific threat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If something like a nightmare can be that intense, does it &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt; something?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was surprised to find relatively little useful material for understanding nightmares outside of a diagnosis or condition linked to nightmares. In the abstract of the study, &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00127-017-1408-7"&gt;Nightmares in the general population&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; (2017),  it backs me up a little bit, saying: &amp;quot;Nightmares are inherently distressing, prevent restorative sleep, and are associated with a number of psychiatric problems, but have rarely been the subject of empirical study.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_interpretation"&gt;Epic of Gilgamesh&lt;/a&gt; to the Bible, it seems like we humans have pretty consistently considered dreams in some kind of supernatural terms. We either have some kind of prophecy framework to interpret them through (e.g. my dream is an omen about the future), or we have a Freudian interpretation framework that still relies heavily on symbolism and subjectivity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ernest Jones made this observation about nightmares:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It is not often realised that most descriptions of Nightmare given by its victims are an inarticulate and feeble echo of the dread reality. This is one result of the general human tendency to shun deep emotions whenever possible, leading to an imperfect appreciation of the intensity of mental suffering.&amp;quot;
—&lt;cite&gt;On the Nightmare&lt;/cite&gt; (1959),  by Ernest Jones, M.D., pg 13-14&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...although the rest of the book explores how medieval monsters (werewolves, vampires, hags, etc.) may have some bearing on how we understand nightmares. His pragmatic insight on our discomfort with deep emotions is still ultimately linked to the supernatural, even if only by the lay-person's conceptualizations, superstitions, and religious influences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to find an intriguing non-Freudian proposal from Henry Kellerman about when nightmares occur:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The nightmare is triggered &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; if a specific emotion-defense is impaired along with an impairment of some disorganization to dreamwork mechanisms so that these mechanisms are inoperative. In such a case the emotion is disregulated, while the primary-process material of a latent dream is similarly unregulated. Under such conditions, the highest intensity of the emotion is experienced, and the dreamer awakens.&amp;quot;
—&lt;cite&gt;The Nightmare: Psychological and Biological Foundations&lt;/cite&gt; (1987), edited by Henry Kellerman, pg 279&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so we still have a bunch of jargon that basically says the same thing: nightmares are intense, we find them alongside our deepest emotions, and we can't escape the strangeness or &amp;quot;supernatural&amp;quot; structures that come with all dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe that's actually kind of cool because, as we've seen from the development of technology, supernatural themes like religion, monstrosity, and other anxiety-inducing metaphors emerge just like what I'm finding with dreams. Of course, please consult with your mental health professional if you are experiencing distress whether because of nightmares or any other causes. I'm no expert here, but I am seeing some interesting threads to pull for exploration's sake—not dismissing the science that is out there in any way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Embracing the Weirdness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a fine line to walk when trying to understand dreams. I see two extremes: dismissal and over-belief. On the dismissal side, perhaps we assign no value to dreams at all. It's just the brain doing its thing and as long as all of the other aspects of mental health are being cared for, it's just what happens sometimes. Over-belief on the other side assigns so much value to the dreams that we may be open to manipulation or scams, or we think that we have some kind of special power or knowledge that comes packaged in a puzzle that we have to figure out. I want to stay away from both of these extreme sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I would like to explore is how to apply some Freudian and literary analysis techniques to try and uncover what is useful to me in understanding nightmares. Instead of looking for divine or supernatural (external) meaning, I'm looking for personal (internal) meaning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here are a few techniques that might be useful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify possible symbols (objects, people, or the setting)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify possible themes (rejection, survival, other story elements)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the context of reality (what has happened to you recently?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider what things or people in the dream are actually placeholders for something or someone else (Freud would say nothing in the dream is literal)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free-associate to find out what these things might actually represent (when I think of XYZ person or object, what comes to mind?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if we take the nightmare I described, there are a few things that stick out to me: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feeling threatened in what is normally a safe, familiar space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking precautions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acting to defend myself when the precautions fail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many things in the real world that could explain how these symbols took shape in my sleeping brain. Maybe I feel like my community is not as safe for me as a queer person as I once thought is was. Maybe the stresses at work have suddenly spiked. Maybe the political environment has become so hostile and unrecognizable that I feel powerless and trapped. Maybe all of these things simultaneously generated the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately the nightmare, in my opinion, can be used as a tool for me to start to unpack what my stressors are. For me, I have a really difficult time identifying &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; I am stressed. It's always after it explodes with anger or snappiness or feeling extreme sadness that finally clues me in. Nightmares might be my brain's way of signaling to me that I'm stressed out and I need to take care of myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way, this is also a helpful exercise in approaching other concepts that are difficult to understand, such as AI. I heard from a coworker that AI-generated videos were like dreams: interesting to the creator only. Maybe that's one way to start unpacking the flood of generated content that is coming: we now have dream-like content that is neither totally meaningless, but neither is it accurate or truthful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scoping this to the more innocuous genres of content (political, scientific, current-event, and historical content needs extra scrutiny and is not compatible with this thought), when we start seeing &amp;quot;artistic&amp;quot; AI videos, we can look for signs that the content is thoughtful, and if it is not, we can dismiss it as easily as we do someone else's dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media is already filled with disingenuous AI content. For example, you may have seen one of many videos where animals are jumping on trampolines as though someone's backyard camera happened to catch something funny. There's also the disturbing AI videos that a certain political leader likes to make in his free time—and if those are a manifestation of his dreams, then we have an entirely different problem, but that's also out of scope for today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, I will be having a lot less FOMO when it comes to general social media, because it will largely be other people's &amp;quot;dreams&amp;quot; that they are enamored with simply because their AI hallucinated something from their prompt. Everything else will require deep analysis to discern authenticity and factuality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cyborg&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t find what I was looking for as I researched nightmares. I was hoping to find something in science that could console me or explain why I have developed these intense experiences somewhat recently (specifically, I was looking for some kind of social dynamic like marginalization as being a cause, or something I could see myself in). What I found instead were principles for understanding difficult and stressful things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaning is always created in your own mind—there is no &lt;em&gt;Meaning&lt;/em&gt; that exists as a separate entity that we have to track down and catch. That's actually comforting to me. It takes the pressure off of putting together a cosmic puzzle with my mortal mind, and instead allows me to choose to engage or not. My dreams and nightmares can be a tool for insight into my underlying stress, with storylines that I can use to consider what is impacting me in real life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While dealing with AI-generated content is going to be a particularly difficult skill in itself, we touched upon a possible tool to add to the toolkit. There may be ways to push this further, because we will all be forced to interact and engage with AI content indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, take care of yourself mentally, emotionally, and physically.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>The Artist as Enemy, Final</title><link>http://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/the-artist-as-enemy-final/</link><description>From museums to shows to in-class critiques to online inspiration boards, I've seen a lot of art.

In a way, I've desensitized myself to art to the point that it is a purely intellectual engagement: what do I like about the craftsmanship? How can this be useful to me? There is a cold utility in this way that I view pieces, and yet I think that's not exclusive to me—perhaps this is a larger cultural issue, perhaps it's due to the Internet and social media, perhaps it's actually always been this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not especially useful to determine some kind of standard for when something becomes art and I cringe when people say things like, &lt;q&gt;you can't create art because you're not an &lt;em&gt;artist&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/q&gt; as though having a paycheck for the art you produce is the only way to validate your artistry. I also understand it's really hard for people to engage with art—at least that's been my observation throughout my life. We're flooded with visual and auditory stimulation thanks to content feeds and streaming platforms of all kinds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What breaks the mold, then? What makes art impactful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I expected more pieces...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the only critiques I received was that someone expected to see many more pieces than the 9 I had displayed. This made me laugh (to myself) because I think this was an expression of how uncomfortable this person really was. I had no pieces that could serve as a resting point (no fluffy kittens or golden fields of wheat to be found). Although this comment is valid (and I had struggled with deciding how many pieces to display), it relates to another reason I think that we have a hard time engaging with art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The restraint was a message. The show was focused, poignant, and intentional. This is the opposite of how we normally have &amp;quot;art&amp;quot; thrust upon us in the commercial world. Online, we see non-stop images and videos. We gobble up the content as though we are starved: trying to stuff as much as we can into our brains by swiping, swiping, swiping, swiping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I literally did this exact thing when I was trying to find something for this newsletter—I stumbled upon a great artist I had never known before and flicked through the carousel of pictures as though I were trying to download it all into my mind within as few seconds as possible. WHY?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I think that restraint is part of what makes art. It’s not just the design of our online experiences that encourages us to gloss over artwork, this happens at art museums. People rush through the exhibit, taking only a few moments for each piece. Restraint is a key part of the experience, just like it is when you are &lt;a href="https://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/the-hardest-skill/"&gt;really listening to someone&lt;/a&gt;. By design, my art show did not have many pieces. It was a small space, people had to walk at least part way to this venue (and in the rain)—that's a lot of work for them, and therefore blasting through the line-up would be a waste of that effort that they took to come all the way out there. Having fewer pieces meant that most people actually looked at each piece multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't know for sure, but I think that the restraint was the right decision to maximize the impact I might have. There were uncomfortable themes, so giving people space to hang out a little bit longer was also an attempt to provide grace and safety. It's ok if they didn't like it or if it caused confusion or if it was unsettling. They were able to sit with it just a little longer, potentially without numbing, and they could do it surrounded by people who were doing the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;You're so talented...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to pretend like I'm some great artist, but actually it makes me a little bit sad when all I hear is, &lt;q&gt;you're so talented.&lt;/q&gt; I understand there are many reasons someone might say this: they didn't know I could draw, so they're expressing their surprise; they don't know what else to say, because they're not used to thinking of art as something to engage with outside of the binary of like it/don't like it; but worst of all, it's because the piece(s) left them uncomfortable and they are deflecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no shame for saying or doing any of these things in reaction to art. I bring this up to reveal what I've seen. I suspect many people have no idea there could be something happening under the surface of a well-intentioned compliment. Obviously, I can't read someone's mind, but from a few interactions I had with my art show, I did get a sense that many people that I know personally were uncomfortable and were trying to deflect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a moment to process what this means when I saw this happening. At first, I figured that the show was a failure—people came out of curiosity and to support me, but the message wasn't getting through. Then I realized that I needed to take my own advice and let them experience what they experience. I can't control their takeaways, their understanding, their feelings. Instead (and thanks to my wife for all of her support), the show may have been a success after all &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; I know it made people uncomfortable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I didn't get art until...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, a friend approached me with a story about the first time an artwork deeply moved them. With tears in their eyes, they said that they had experienced the same thing there at the show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think there's anything more precious than to know that something I created was able to communicate and connect with someone that deeply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a similar experience recently as I made my way through an LGBTQ+ art show. I had been going through the long line of pieces, when suddenly a table with a sculpture interrupted everything. I looked at the piece and began to weep. &lt;cite&gt;Cyclebreaker,&lt;/cite&gt; it said on the little card in front of it. It was about the struggle and the hope of resilience in breaking out of abuse. Nothing has ever moved me the way that piece did. Until then, I knew intellectually that art could make an impact. Now I'm feeling it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing and image-making has been an integral, continuous part of my life. So much so that I didn't appreciate art in terms of its impact. It was solely about utility or fun. I was expecting my art show to change other people. I wanted to inspire action to protect immigrant rights and to fiercely defend humanity, even in policies. I can't say whether the show did or did not do those things, but I do know how it changed me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many times I proclaim things like &lt;q&gt;art is impactful,&lt;/q&gt; or &lt;q&gt;always remember humanity,&lt;/q&gt; just because I want to &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; that it's true or I want to remind myself of my values when I have a hard time retaining them. This show was a part of an experiment to see if any of this was real. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for indulging a three-part series about art and this art show. I fear many things right now, and I especially fear the loss of community and connection. I also feel a sense of hope because I was able to do a very difficult thing for me: reach out to my local community. I stepped into the role of the artist as the enemy by creating emotional pieces about topics that we don't like to talk about in-person (but will rage about online). It was a vulnerable event for me, and it was a vulnerable event for those who came, and we all did it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>The Artist as Enemy, Part Two</title><link>http://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/the-artist-as-enemy-part-two/</link><description>I hardly slept the night before my art show.

All of the things I still needed or wanted to solve ran through my head like an un-ending chorus from &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; Lamb Chops song (if you know, you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; know, haha!), but there was an underlying stress. The deep worry that I was putting myself in danger. After all, these were meaningful pieces to me, but they were also sharp critiques of harmful culture or ideologies. I had stepped into the &amp;quot;artist as enemy&amp;quot; shoes with trepidation, but it was far too late to back out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on what we looked at last week, I was trying to fulfill the important role of an artist in &lt;a href="https://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/the-artist-as-enemy-part-one/"&gt;making visible what sometimes hides in the background&lt;/a&gt; (or the &amp;quot;environment&amp;quot;). Here's the crux of the discovery we made when we looked at some of Marshall McLuhan's arguments in his essay, &lt;cite&gt;The relation of environment to anti-environment&lt;/cite&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When an environment is new, we perceive the old one for the first time...when the Emperor appeared in his new clothes, his courtiers did not see his nudity, they saw his old clothes. Only the small child and the artist have the immediacy of approach that permits perception of the environmental.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;—McLuhan, page 18&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The environment we're in is new, and it's dangerous. So let's finally explore some of the tools that an artist (or perhaps a small child) uses to both perceive and draw attention to that which normally escapes our notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools of the Trade&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've mentioned before that my art was utterly unremarkable as a college art student. I recall being frustrated by this because I was aware of the problem, but not aware of &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I couldn't make things that really moved people. &lt;em&gt;I just don't have anything to say,&lt;/em&gt; I thought to myself very frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I didn't have anything to say is that I was ignorant of the environment—the background of systems, emotions, people, and even myself. In other words, I was disconnected. I make this point at the start to re-emphasize that &amp;quot;being an artist&amp;quot; is not what's actually required. I'm not exclusivist when it comes to art—I believe that art and creativity are deeply &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; and therefore not confined to a few genius craftsmen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the reason why artists and small children are &lt;em&gt;more likely&lt;/em&gt; to be able to see what others can't is because the practice of art trains you to see. If small children are unencumbered by the social pressure of only seeing what you're &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to see, then art is a way to tap back into that freedom, although it doesn't guarantee that vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing is one way to practice your sight. Most people stop drawing after a young age and get stuck with symbols to draw, rather than drawing what the eye perceives. For example, if I pull someone off the street and tell them to draw a person, most likely they'll produce some kind of stick figure. The fact that you know what a &amp;quot;stick figure&amp;quot; even is, shows how prevalent these pre-baked symbols are in our minds. A person looks nothing like a stick figure, but we've been trained to draw people in this way. Someone who has practiced drawing—even if only a little bit—will more likely produce something that resembles a person's shape. Same thing goes for other body parts like hands, lips, eyes, hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To draw is to see. The more you draw, the more you see. &lt;a href="https://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/drawing-on-memory/"&gt;Drawing can help create rich memories of what you experience&lt;/a&gt; in addition to developing your ability to notice the small subtleties around you. This is a potent tool to help anyone get a grasp on the environment because the more you notice the small things around you, the more you will start to notice in the other layers of the world, whether it be systems or emotions or things that aren't right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A less-tangible tool that you can access is what Dan Pink calls &amp;quot;Symphony&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Symphony] is the capacity to synthesize rather than to analyze; to see relationships between seemingly unrelated fields; to detect broad patterns rather than to deliver specific answers; and to invent something new by combining elements nobody else thought to pair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—&lt;cite&gt;A Whole New Mind&lt;/cite&gt;, Daniel H. Pink (2005), page 130&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pattern recognition seems basic or automatic thanks to our brains, but it can be &amp;quot;upgraded&amp;quot; into a skill if pursued. Unfortunately, it is easy to forget about or ignore this in the current world. I certainly have trouble thinking long-term and big-picture when I'm trapped in a content feed, jumping from one random topic to the next in rapid succession. It takes intention and restraint to hold space so that you can process what you perceive and start to identify relationships and broad patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have found two concrete ways that have helped me develop a systems-thinking mindset:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Answer a question with a question&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celebrate negative space (also see newsletter, &lt;a href="https://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/horror-vacui/"&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Horror Vacui&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've noticed that when people ask questions, we rarely give them space to &lt;a href="https://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/are-we-asking-the-right-question/"&gt;ask the right question&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of allowing a question time and space, we shove an answer onto it as quickly as possible. This isn't inherently bad—sometimes it's insightful to see what comes out of my mouth without thinking—but I've very much enjoyed the practice of asking a question in response to a question as a means of getting a deeper understanding. This is particularly useful in consultation situations, but it also works well in casual conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celebrating negative space (the space in between focal points or subjects) is another practice. I watched an insightful video about &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScpuByTfn3g&amp;amp;pp=0gcJCfwJAYcqIYzv"&gt;Japanese ways of seeing space&lt;/a&gt; and a concept called, &lt;em&gt;yohaku no bi&lt;/em&gt;, seems to be familiar, thinking of Marshall McLuhan's observations about environment (background) and anti-environment (foreground/subject). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negative space is usually treated as background, a supporting element for the main subject. Yohaku, however, celebrates the blankness itself, the margin left intentionally unfilled, where subject and space depend on each other for meaning...Yohaku no bi treats empty space as a living element in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—&lt;cite&gt;Japanese Ways of Seeing Space: Ma, Yohaku no Bi, and Subtraction&lt;/cite&gt;, Dans Le Gris, timestamp 3:50&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we slow down and focus on what is in between what we normally see, the environment starts to move into view. The negative space helps us see the relationships between other relationships. We start to recognize larger patterns as we examine more closely the familiar &amp;quot;things&amp;quot; in our world (physical or not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Show Time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was very surprised by the experience of the art show: people actually came, people were kind, people had important conversations about pertinent issues. In fact, I came away from the experience changed in a way I did not anticipate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to best explain, I want to be able to show you as much as tell you, so I'll leave you on another cliff-hanger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I hope that knowing about these few tools is empowering for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be continued...&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>The Artist as Enemy, Part One</title><link>http://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/the-artist-as-enemy-part-one/</link><description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any new technology, any extension or amplification of human faculties when given material embodiment, tends to create a new environment...It is in the interplay between the old and the new environments that there is generated an innumerable series of problems and confusions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—&lt;em&gt;The relation of environment to anti-environment&lt;/em&gt;, Marshall McLuhan, page 6&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are creatures of our environment; both nature and nurture are features of it. We cannot escape our environments and yet, most of the time the environment seems to escape &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt;—our attention, at least. In order to make sense of our situation, our world, we have a few tools at the ready to help pull the environment out of the background noise and into our focus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we look at those tools, we need to first understand what Marshall McLuhan meant by new technologies creating new environments—and that it is largely when a new environment is created that we start to really see the old environment. Let's start with a quick example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet is just a huge file-and-folder structure linked together and stored on someone else's &amp;quot;computers.&amp;quot; This seems obvious to developer-type people, but to everyone else, that framework is entirely missed. If you happen to be a Windows user, the File Explorer makes it easier to see the connection, because it shows you the &amp;quot;path&amp;quot; (think URL) of wherever you are currently looking on your computer, just like the browser does with the URL. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A website is composed of one huge folder, a.k.a. the domain, then you can explore sub-folders as far as you can go. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://cyborgnewsletter.com/ (The big folder)&lt;br&gt;
https://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/ (the newsletters sub-folder)&lt;br&gt;
https://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/what-am-i/ (the document, &amp;quot;What Am I&amp;quot; inside the subfolder)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a little bit simplistic, but the metaphor of files and folders, stolen from the older environment of real-world files and folders, is a really solid foundation for understanding what websites really are and how they work. However, the Internet is still a new environment in my opinion, and that's likely why there's so much confusion or total blindness to the basics of websites: how they work, what they can do, how dangerous they can be, how useful they can be, how they are both simple and complex, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's an Environment?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An environment is naturally of low intensity or low definition. That is why it escapes observation. Anything that raises the environment to high intensity, whether it be a storm in nature or violent change resulting from a new technology, such high intensity turns the environment into an object of attention. When an environment becomes an object of attention, it assumes the character of an anti-environment or an art object. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—McLuhan, page 11&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McLuhan sets up two opposing concepts: the environment and the anti-environment. The artist in me wants to simplify it to &amp;quot;background&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;foreground,&amp;quot; because the background usually &amp;quot;escapes observation&amp;quot; in a painting or a drawing, while the subject in the foreground is what is calling our attention. Under this model, we can watch how technology changes how we behave and interact with the world and each other as systems either fade into the background or become inescapably noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can already start to recognize McLuhan's observation about technology and environments by looking at the Internet, again. There is a massive trend now (arguably for a decade or so) of people obsessing over physical notebooks, note-taking, and even reading. I see this as part of a response to the &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; environment of the Internet, which is hiding in plain sight as background, while the &amp;quot;old&amp;quot; environment of physical knowledge-related objects have suddenly moved into the foreground to capture our attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Watching the World Change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many things can become the background or the foreground, but McLuhan does call out that society itself cannot be the background. I think that's because there has to be a third party in the model: an observer; the attention-giver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventionally, society is always one phase back, is never environmental. Paradoxically, it is the antecedent environment that is always being upgraded for our attention. The new environment always uses the old environment as its material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—McLuhan, page 11&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like the example of websites being just a bunch of files and folders (old environment), it takes that old metaphor and remixes it into something impossible in the old environment: interactivity, scaling the access to potentially the entire globe, becoming a destination and not just a container for information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example that is even more tangible is music. McLuhan says that the music of the concert hall was anti-environment (foreground), because it was the content inside of the environment. You went to a concert hall for the purpose of hearing the music. Technology changed that game when music could be played whenever you wanted, wherever you wanted. In McLuhan's time, that probably meant vinyl records or maybe tapes. We have continued to push music into the environment as CDs, MP3 players, and online radios and libraries have been developed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these technologies, music has not only become a background—only noticed when it has stopped playing—it has also changed in the social dimension. &amp;quot;...when music becomes environmental by electric means, it becomes more and more the concern of the private individual&amp;quot; (McLuhan, pg. 13). The concert hall was a ritual for a group to participate in. The music on a tape, an MP3 player, or a smartphone is almost exclusively for a single person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what were those tools we have to lean on to help us sort through the mess of these new technologies and get some clarity on where we currently are?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Enemy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The artist as a maker of anti-environment permits us to perceive that much is newly environmental and therefore most active in transforming situations. This would seem to be why the artist has in many circles in the past century been called the enemy, the criminal. It helps to explain why news has a natural bias toward crime and bad news. It is this kind of news that enables us to perceive our world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—McLuhan, page 11&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an artist myself, I was really intrigued by the realization that we are &amp;quot;called the enemy,&amp;quot; though my foggy memory of art history classes confirms this. Perhaps it has only been more recently that the artists have started to become heroes instead of just weirdos. The artist as enemy, to me, actually gives me more purpose than the artist as hero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in university, I felt torn between two personas: the ingenious strategist that would help businesses succeed and grow, and the outspoken voice of warning or protest. Maybe a lot of that had to do with being torn between traditional art as a major and graphic design (which I ended up choosing). The traditional artists I learned from—whether as professors or those from art history—often saw their work as saying something or being part of some huge purpose. It was common for the artists with the greatest influence to be the ones that critiqued &amp;quot;the system&amp;quot; or government or other social and cultural norms. They were the rebels, the enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own art at the time reflected my inability to see the &amp;quot;environment&amp;quot; of theses systems, which is why most of the pieces I made are utterly unremarkable. I wanted to be the hero, not the enemy. In trying so hard to fit in, to not rock the boat, to ignore what I could see, I failed to fully inhabit that role of artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an environment is new, we perceive the old one for the first time...when the Emperor appeared in his new clothes, his courtiers did not see his nudity, they saw his old clothes. Only the small child and the artist have the immediacy of approach that permits perception of the environmental. The artist provides us with anti-environments that enable us to see the environment. Such anti-environmental means of perception must constantly be renewed in order to be efficacious...in an age of accelerated change, the need to perceive the environment becomes urgent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—McLuhan, page 18&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tools that an artist uses to critique and create are the tools that are available to all of us, though it has often been the artists that assume the responsibility of helping the rest of us see. That's why I'm sticking my neck out a little bit and trying an experiment. I'm stepping into the shoes of enemy artist, and I'm creating a private art show that critiques the oppressive systems in our current environment. My goal is to generate in-person conversations about the difficult stuff we'd rather ignore or rage about anonymously online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the first time my art has meant something. It's the first time I want people to see the pieces. I'll let you know how it goes, wish me luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be continued...&lt;/p&gt;

I am unable to pull myself away from all of the &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; movies and the new show, &lt;em&gt;Alien Earth.&lt;/em&gt; It's been puzzling me because it's been so captivating, and I think I'm seeing an interesting connection between our real world problems and my fascination with the discomfort and disgust of these horrible stories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We Used to Be Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the moments at the very beginning of the &lt;em&gt;Alien Earth&lt;/em&gt; series that gave me serious pause for reflection was this little observation from the synthetic chief scientist, Kirsh:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You used to be food, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your lives were short and filled with fear. Then your brains grew. You built tools and used them to conquer nature. You built impossible machines and went to space. You stopped being food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, I should say, you told yourself you weren't food anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the animal kingdom, there is always someone bigger or smaller who would eat you alive if they had the chance. That's what it is to be an animal. You're born. You live. You die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's chilling to think that even in this big world that we've created around us, it still doesn't shield us from nature. Rarely, that means those bigger or fiercer creatures that you could run into by chance, but maybe more often it's the nature of the micro-scale: the disease, the virus, or even systemic issues from the environment to our own bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong, at least in the wealthiest countries, we have done &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt; to improve the quality of our lives, to be able to have a relatively low infant mortality rate, to have vaccines that promote the health of communities, to be able to slow the progression of incurable diseases. And it's not enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help explain, I lean on a grotesque scene in the second episode of &lt;em&gt;Alien Earth&lt;/em&gt; (I'll spare the gory details and keep it light). A ship has crashed into a huge building on Earth, carrying several species of aliens, including the infamous xenomorph (the beautifully designed creature from the &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; franchise), which obviously escapes from the crashed spaceship to terrorize and kill everything it can find in the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rescue team is sent in to try and find any injured people from the crash and assess the scene. One medic, Joe Hermit, gets separated while being chased by the xenomorph. He manages to evade the monster and gets to the 65th floor of the building and reunites with another search party soldier. They find a room full of people dressed in Victorian garb—curly white-haired wigs, puffy sleeves, corsets and all. These are wealthy elites, sitting mindlessly at the top of their tower, complaining about all of the noise caused by the spaceship crashing into the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well I'm sure if it's a real problem, Boy Kavalier will call me personally. We belong to the same club,&amp;quot; the man the script calls &amp;quot;His Lordship&amp;quot; says as he ignores the soldier and medic's attempts at getting them to evacuate. The xenomorph conveniently reveals itself shortly after the absurd scene and lays waste to all of the foolish rich people in their fancy outfits. You can almost hear the message: Your money means nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used to be food. We decided we weren't going to be anymore. But are we really any different than how we started?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to skip this next paragraph if you don't want the image in your head, I include it for those who have seen the show:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To drive this point home even further, the episode puts up two horrible, parallel shots. The first is with the rescue crew that gets into the wrecked spaceship. They find a cat aboard that has been so badly injured that it drags itself along the floor with its two front paws. Later at the 65th floor dinner party, His Lordship is seen crawling in the same manner—legs no longer part of his body. Man and animal in precise harmony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Refuge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology has been touted for so long as a saving force. We know there is a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of Western Christian imagery and themes that are bound into our current set of technology. Tech is often talked about as if it were a serpent on a staff, raised to save those who would simply look upon it, or maybe it's the Savior figure himself: the incomprehensible solution to every problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is a scary place and nature acts as an inscrutable, impersonal, violent force. It giveth and it taketh away—then it destroyeth and decayeth. Sometimes nature &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; like an encounter with the xenomorph. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inexorable laws of nature alone will do nicely to crush my own egotistical sense of power in the world, and I don't need to read the universal uncontrollable forces as being transcendental or wholly other. This is why, I think, the biological monsters created by H.R. Giger in Ridley Scott's film &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; are so horrific: we are as helpless (at least in the first three acts) in the face of these natural selection machines as we are before any traditional deity...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—&lt;em&gt;On Monsters&lt;/em&gt;, Stephen T. Asma, 192&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this tension between the harshness of the natural world and the parallel, but at least human-made, technological world is what makes these movies and aliens so attention-grabbing to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a sense of control in our technology: I feel empowered every time I get something I've programmed working. I turn on a fan when I feel too warm in my office. I fill up my water bottle from inside my own home when I'm thirsty. These are incredible, unthinkably powerful things. I also have a disease (multiple sclerosis) that I carry with me, that may lash out at me at any unsuspecting moment. The weather can destroy my home or threaten my safety. Something as simple and tiny as a virus could kill me from within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The safety and comfort of technology surrounds me, and yet I know I'm still a vulnerable little animal at my core. That puts me on edge. It's not the ever-present potential of threat that a squirrel might experience out in the wild, it's a subtle anxiety that hides in the shadows of my thoughts: &lt;em&gt;What if?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monsters of contemporary horror are not like their medieval counterparts, who were more like God's henchman. That older paradigm held out the inevitability of monstrous defeat by divine justice, but the contemporary monster is often a reminder of theological abandonment and the accompanying angst. Nor are the more recent horror monsters like the monsters of the Enlightenment, products of human superstition that can be conquered by the light of reason. Monsters after Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and Freud are features of the irrevocable irrationality inside the human subject and outside in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;cite&gt;On Monsters&lt;/cite&gt;, 202&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cyborg&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point here is not exacerbate our anxieties, but to also try and avoid being the idiotic, clueless cos-players at the 65th floor dinner party. When we become too insulated and too used to our wealth or privilege, we become vulnerable to the surprises of nature. The fix is not to become overly anxious nor to become draconic hoarders. I think part of the fix is the opposite: gratitude and resource-sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gratitude is noticing that the water flows cleanly and reliably from the tap. Gratitude is noticing that the dark, scary, spider-filled part of the garage can be illuminated with a light switch or a flashlight. Gratitude says, &lt;em&gt;I have enough&lt;/em&gt;, then considers, &lt;em&gt;Maybe I have more than enough, and I can share&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resource-sharing is not just about your individual contributions, though of course that is valuable and impressive. When I think about the current real-life threats to modern humans, disease and AI are the biggest threats that come to mind, but I'm starting to wonder if we need more focus on disease right now. Consider these two examples from Jonathan Kennedy's excellent research:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis was another major killer in the slums of industrializing Europe, but it declined in high-income countries as living and working conditions improved, antibiotics were developed and national immunization programs were introduced in the mid-twentieth century. And yet, despite the fact that there is a cheap and reasonably effective vaccine available...it is still the most deadly infectious disease in the world. It kills about 1.2 million people a year, almost all of whom live in lower- and middle-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—&lt;em&gt;Pathogenesis&lt;/em&gt;, Jonathan Kennedy, (2023), pg 206&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because COVID-19 is such an infectious pathogen, the hoarding of vaccines is not just callous selfishness on the part of high income countries: it is potentially a massive own goal that could very well prolong the pandemic and increase the likelihood of new, more dangerous variants emerging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—&lt;em&gt;Pathogenesis&lt;/em&gt;, 224&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wealth &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt; shields us from a lot of issues, day-to-day dangers, and diseases in general, but it is not infallible. I'm convinced that the greater the disparity between the rich and the poor—at whatever scale you want to look at, global or local—the greater the risk to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; people, regardless of wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than learning from the COVID-19 pandemic we barely got through, we have watched politicians and other actors gut the very institutions that are at the forefront of public health. Programs like USAID were destroyed, which helped world-wide health initiatives—not only saving lives, but doing the work that's needed to keep pathogenic threats at bay. We are dressing ourselves up in ignorant, fancy clothes and insulating ourselves in a dinner party far from the inconveniences of &amp;quot;lesser&amp;quot; people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we as a society turn away and turn inward, are we setting ourselves up to becoming the food again? Not to the xenomorph. This time, it's not &amp;quot;someone bigger&amp;quot; that will take the advantage of our vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>What Am I?</title><link>http://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/what-am-i/</link><description>A body lays on the cold metal table, her head is encircled by a plastic-looking structure—not unlike a bedpan in shape and size—which is glowing blue.

She's dressed in what could be considered long-Johns or thermals. A child approaches the empty table beside the one the body occupies. This child, Marcy, has no hair, possibly because of chemo-therapy. She's about to take the first leap towards transhumanism by being digitally transferred from her frail, sick body into a synthetic, powerful one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the beginning of a subplot in the new TV series, &lt;cite&gt;Alien Earth&lt;/cite&gt;, and it is an exquisite exploration of humanity, self, and the consequences of technology interacting with both. No real spoilers here, so if you're still wanting to get started on the show (which I highly recommend if you can stand the gore and horror—none of which will be in this newsletter), you should be pretty safe to read on...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hybrids&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a range of humanoid beings in the &lt;cite&gt;Alien&lt;/cite&gt; universe, and &lt;cite&gt;Alien Earth&lt;/cite&gt; specifies three from the first frame of the entire show:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cyborgs: Humans with technological enhancements (human body and mind—mostly)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hybrids: Synthetic beings with human consciousness (previously human before downloading their consciousness into the new body)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Synths: Synthetic beings with artificial intelligence (entirely non-human)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hybrids in the show are the very first of their kind. They are the seemingly successful creations of a corporation called &lt;em&gt;Prodigy&lt;/em&gt;, run by trillionaire man-child, Boy Kavalier. Boy's scientists and technologists created the synthetic bodies and to finish the experiment, they selected a small group of children with life-threatening diseases or debilitating conditions to undergo the transfer of consciousness from their bodies into their new &amp;quot;immortal&amp;quot; bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's an interesting concept: if it were possible to somehow duplicate your brain with some kind of series of snapshots that build the model of your consciousness in the digital realm, is a download all that is really needed at that point? I mean, if you, yourself, are simply a collection of memories and goals, then who knows? This could be a possibility in the distant future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, but here we have already come to the philosophical snag in the concept of hybrids: is that truly the entire self? Some musty, imperfect memories and a collection of weird impulses to pursue intellectually or physically? In addition to the concern that this is not all that creates our &amp;quot;self,&amp;quot; there is the question of whether the process of transfer would remove our humanity. Meaning, is our humanity also linked to our human bodies? Are these hybrids still humans after the process? Are they even the same people that they were before, just in a different body?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-executive producer of &lt;cite&gt;Alien Earth&lt;/cite&gt;, Migizi Pensoneau, shared some thoughts on the show's official podcast that are helpful. (Yes, my surprising and sudden obsession with this show runs &lt;em&gt;deep&lt;/em&gt;...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;quot;My personal opinion on the humanity of a hybrid is that I just wrote them as humans...You're writing these characters not as the sort of synthetic bodies or the way that they're perceived, but you...melt that away and you get down to the fact that these are kids going through this new experience that nobody before them has ever been through.&amp;quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—&lt;cite&gt;Alien Earth - The Official Podcast&lt;/cite&gt;, episode 1&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so he seemed to see the humanity in these hybrid characters, and I would agree from the portrayal in the show. The hybrids pass the Turing test when Marcy's brother says she feels like his sister, though something like our &lt;a href="/glossary/hadd-theory/"&gt;HADD bias&lt;/a&gt; may still be at play, tricking us into seeing what we want to see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pensoneau adds one more variable to the complexity of this issue of humanity, that I think is particularly important:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...it's really our consciousness, our sense of self that makes a human human. And for me, I would take it one step further that it's not just our relationship to ourself or the awareness of us having a self, but instead it is a relationship to others and how we care for or how we feel about others. That connection to another person, another being, another creature or whatever...we are connected on some level to other beings around us. And I think that the hybrids, even though their bodies are synthetic, their consciousness is constantly reaching out towards others...that was enough for me to say they're human.&amp;quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—&lt;cite&gt;Alien Earth - The Official Podcast&lt;/cite&gt;, episode 2&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Self&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The uncomfortable part of philosophizing about one's Self is that things get confusing (I blame &lt;a href="/glossary/prototype-theory/"&gt;Prototype Theory&lt;/a&gt;, in part). The moment we start drawing lines around concepts, the less we get out of the concepts. For example, if my Self, my consciousness, is wholly dependent upon my likes, dislikes, memories, goals, and even my autonomy, then how am I any different than a rat or a moth? Humans are social creatures, so it makes sense that part of our humanity would not just include our concept of Self, but also our relationships to others (human and non-human alike). As soon as we introduce other Selves, they start to influence &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; Self—so where is the line of my Self, separate from other Selves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's that fixation on trying to draw boundaries that is the root of the issue. We are not healthy in total isolation of others. We are made of the ancestors that came before, the contemporary humans we interact with, and our own Self also influences and interacts with our contemporaries and our genetic circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reverend Elizabeth M. Edman wrote an excellent examination of the tension between our own Self and the Other in her book, &lt;cite&gt;Queer Virtue&lt;/cite&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
One way people get it wrong is by radicalizing the separation of Self and Other. Perhaps the worst version of this happens when the Other becomes cast not just as different, but despised...The Despised Other is someone who has become so alien to you that you stop being able to conceive of that person as human.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;page 22&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inverse of the Despised Other would be the collapse of those categories as distinct at all. Co-opting the Other into one's Self can be a profoundly abusive act. Sometimes the collapse is the result of a kind of suffocating faux love. Sometimes it is born of privilege that simply fails to perceive that there are others present who are markedly different...Either way, as with the invention of the Despised Other, the end result is an erasure of the Other's humanity, rendering a person or community invisible or nonexistent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are extreme situations, to be sure, but the fundamental balancing act in navigating the relationship between Self and Other exists for all of us. You and I could come up with hundreds of daily, mundane situations in which clarity about Self and Other is something that you have to figure out, outcomes that affect your well-being or the well-being of another person. Understanding and negotiating one's sense of self and one's connection to others, drawing appropriate boundaries while maintaining necessary interconnection, is of vital importance. Getting it right, maybe the core ethical challenge of the human condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;page 22-23&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...and that's all with just plain old humans in human bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I love getting confounded by these philosophical puzzles, I also worry that we get distracted by science fiction as we argue about the humanity of some invented character in an invented world. I worry because I see it in myself: anger and injury leading me to deny the humanity of other humans—even the truly awful humans. I'd rather sit in a haze thinking about whether a consciousness keeps its initial humanity as it transfers to another body than reconsider how I am currently talking about a harmful public figure or politician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I echo Reverend Edman's words, if only to try and convince myself to remember: &amp;quot;Understanding and negotiating one's sense of self and one's connection to others, drawing appropriate boundaries while maintaining necessary interconnection, is of vital importance.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cyborg&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As actual science is catching up with science fiction, we find new applications for these metaphors. While we don't need to be overly concerned with hybrids in the real world right now, the idea of hybrids can still help us work out issues that we are facing right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more I consider what makes hybrids human or not helps me work out my own humanity. What makes me human? What values do I want to express? What are the things I cannot lose, because their loss would remove my own humanity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, just like the squishy boundaries of considering Self and Other, as I consider humanity I find myself in a more expansive state that includes more than just humans. We are part of an environment with other life forms and my actions—even my existence—affect the world around me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implication in &lt;cite&gt;Alien Earth&lt;/cite&gt; is that this transfer of consciousness only goes one way: one of the scientists remarks that worst case, they just killed a bunch of kids. Sometimes it feels like we are also going through this process of transfer as the digital realm continuously pulls us back to it. However, we have a unique option available to us with our current real-life technology. We can move to the digital environment, but we can also move back into our bodies and interact with the real world again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren't trapped in the synthetic, altered state that corporations would prefer for us to be trapped in. Right now we can still make the choice to be embodied humans and enjoy what that means for good and bad, health and sickness. We can still make the choice to see the humanity in every human, even though the digital realm often encourages the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes up your humanity?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>At the speed of thought</title><link>http://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/at-the-speed-of-thought/</link><description>The tantalizing message of working &amp;quot;at the speed of thought&amp;quot; is something I've heard from conflicting places.

My typography professor in college was first, making the case for starting designs with a simple pencil-and-paper tech stack. Because the pencil is so simple it allows you to place your plans and thoughts into the physical realm at almost the speed that you have those plans and thoughts. Later I heard this same phrase used by another designer, this time to support his argument that professionals must learn the keyboard shortcuts to a program so that you can create in an unencumbered way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both of these instances, designers were arguing that technology (whether ancient or modern) allows us to produce what we want as close to mental conception as possible. It's a beautiful, divine idea, to think that our mere thoughts could be brought into life—what greater show of power and creativity is there than to think something into being?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generative AI makes similar promises: Now you can do anything you want, no need to become a coder and a writer and a marketer. Just speak what you will and this all-knowing digital servant shall make it so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that LLMs are past the party-trick phase and can actually be helpful—and are simultaneously and equally dangerous—I'm starting to question this beloved phrase, &amp;quot;at the speed of thought.&amp;quot; What was once a mantra that helped me make decisions about processes and tools is now a call for thinking about my thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Assumption&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's baked into the phrase, but to put it more explicitly, the assumption is that our thoughts are valuable and we should be racing to capture them as fast as possible. There may be some truth to this, because much of the time, I do wish I could capture my thoughts. Of course there are many thoughts that are not worth capturing, but it can be hard to know the worth of a thought until after it has been put down on paper or in some other physical manifestation. I have also noticed that the thought loses quality as it gets expressed or captured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I've had some amazing thoughts about themes in this newsletter. I'll read something in a book and a chain reaction gets set off in my mind as I've stumbled upon some majestic connection between everything I've ever known. It's thrilling and fun. Then I sit down to write it and it's a complete mess, hardly a transition in sight, weak arguments, and silly examples. It doesn't matter if I did everything right: jotting down notes, quick sketches, and high-level outlines immediately upon having the thought. The thought has moved from the environment of my mind (my memories, experiences, knowledge, biases, etc.) and into the physical world. It's a &lt;em&gt;translation&lt;/em&gt; process, and there is always something lost or changed in any kind of translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So even given the perfect conditions where there is no memory loss involved, &amp;quot;working at the speed of thought&amp;quot; can only ever be an aspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Consequences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it is so aspirational, you can bet that we'll continue to attempt to develop some method of production at the speed of thought, although you can argue we're already pretty close. The sheer volume of thoughts released into the world via social media alone is staggering. However, there may be more at stake than being further inundated by the amount of &amp;quot;stuff&amp;quot; to sort through on the Internet. To explore this, it's time to formally introduce you to Marshall McLuhan, the name that inevitably comes up in every book about technology, mass media, philosophy of tech, and other such CYBORG_ genres that I've dug through so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McLuhan is a philosopher who has a profound grasp of the impact that technology has had on us. He died in 1980, which makes many of his insights all the more intriguing since he mostly missed the computer age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his essay, &lt;cite&gt;At the Moment of Sputnik the Planet Became a Global Theater in which There Are No Spectators, But Only Actors,&lt;/cite&gt; McLuhan explores how technology may be propelling us beyond speech, because of how instantaneously information can be accessed and understood. He wasn't talking about the Internet in this piece—he was largely referring to TV!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He sets the stage by explaining how humans have acted differently in the various states of information-technological innovation, i.e. before reading/writing calling them &amp;quot;preliterate/simultaneous man&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Gutenberg man&amp;quot; meaning after the printing press; and the &amp;quot;electronic man&amp;quot; which he argues began in 1957 after Sputnik was launched into space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ecological thinking and planning have always been native to preliterate man, since he lived not visually but acoustically. Instead of having external goals and objectives, he sought to maintain an equilibrium among the components of his environment in order to ensure survival. Paradoxically, electronic man shares much of the outlook of preliterate man, because he lives in a world of simultaneous information, which is to say, a world of resonance in which all data influence other data. Electronic and simultaneous man has recovered the primordial attitudes of the preliterate world and has discovered that to have a specialized goal or program merely invites conflict with all other specialized enterprises.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—&lt;cite&gt;At the Moment of Sputnik&lt;/cite&gt;, McLuhan, pg 4-5&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not that we're now overloaded with information like never before. McLuhan makes the case that we have a lot in common with ancient humans who were fully immersed in the natural world, which is brimming with information—specifically sensory information like sounds, smells, and sights, but also danger and all of the clues surrounding those dangers. To me, this highlights the real issue is in the &lt;em&gt;incentives and design&lt;/em&gt; behind our technology, in particular the attention economy. If, as McLuhan asserts, humanity used to operate in an environment of constant simultaneous information, then we already know what to do and we're probably even evolutionarily set up for success. The issue is that we've created systems that trap us in patterns of information consumption with little ability or leftover energy to process, rest, and move forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system is designed to not just encourage equilibrium (as in, engagement with the platform) but to make it almost impossible to choose not to accept the equilibrium. It's as if we placed ourselves back in the environment of over-stimulation but we also intentionally removed or corrupted all of the psychology, social dynamics, and evolutionary tools that could have helped us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McLuhan continues on, describing how the electronic man &amp;quot;seeks pattern recognition&amp;quot; in contrast to how the Gutenberg man sought distant goals. This also follows the logic of our current times where we are in frequent danger of deception and tribalism. There is so much information, the only strategy is to keep looking for the content that validates what you already think, and algorithms and artificial intelligence are extremely effective at feeding your biases and keeping you addicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology is not inherently bad, but there are pitfalls, especially when companies designing the tech are incentivized to harvest your attention and engagement. It's beyond the scope of today's newsletter, but I highly recommend listening to this podcast that explains further why this incentive is so dangerous:
&lt;a href="https://www.humanetech.com/podcast/how-openai-s-chatgpt-guided-a-teen-to-his-death"&gt;How OpenAI's ChatGPT Guided a Teen to His Death - Your Undivided Attention Podcast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Experience and The Meaning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one more fascinating insight that McLuhan offers to us as we think about our thinking and our experience in our technological environment of high-speed thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
At present, electric speed may already have violated human scale, tending, as it does to transport man instantly everywhere. When you are &amp;quot;on the air&amp;quot; you are simultaneously here, and in many other places in a manner that is discarnate and angelic, to say the least.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—&lt;cite&gt;At the Moment of Sputnik&lt;/em&gt;, McLuhan, pg 17&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we are plugged into almost everything almost everywhere, information not only increases, but something happens to our own experience. McLuhan references a poet (I'm not sure who, specifically) who said, &amp;quot;we can have the experience and miss the meaning.&amp;quot; He then takes the idea further:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In fact, such is the nature of experience that it is almost inevitable that we do miss the meaning. The &amp;quot;meaning&amp;quot; or the relation to ourselves of a particular event, may not come home to us until much later. However, with the instant replay of our own or others' experiences, it is now possible to have the meaning without the experience.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—&lt;cite&gt;At the Moment of Sputnik&lt;/cite&gt;, McLuhan, pg 18&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what gives me pause as I consider working and producing at the speed of thought. In all of the rush, we may still be communicating the meaning, but if we are losing the experience, does that not diminish the meaning at the same time? For example, I can be emotionally moved by a video about a tragedy that is occurring in the world, but if I immediately move onto the next cat video I'm presented with, the meaning of the previous video has been erased. I took no action, I immediately soothed my discomfort with entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe moving at the speed of thought devalues the human connections that we are desperately seeking. The more we feel and then numb and then feel and then numb in such a relentless stream, the more desensitized we may end up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowness seems to be the key to quality whether in thoughts, relationships, or learning. Slowness is a human need that conflicts with the human wants. How can we insert more slowness into our lives, given the environment around us encouraging the opposite? That's the question I'm thinking about a lot lately, and while asking a question can generate many instant thoughts, I'm waiting and working on them in the hopes that slowing down will help me find a quality answer to how to slow down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not all hopeless, though. If McLuhan has demonstrated such a good grasp of what we're dealing with already, there is a chance that we, the public, may also have inherited a power previously unavailable to us. He says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The mysterious thing about this kind of speed-up of information, whereby the gap is closed between the experience and the meaning, is that the public begins to participate directly in actions which it had previously heard about at a distance in place or time. At instant speed, the audience becomes actor, and the spectators become participants.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—&lt;cite&gt;At the Moment of Sputnik&lt;/cite&gt;, McLuhan, pg 18&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of forces at work trying to keep the public in stasis; in equilibrium. There are a lot of dangers as people seek power and wield oppression to get more power. But maybe, just maybe, the broader public finally also has a chance to subvert the patterns of history. We don't have to be spectators who are only able to understand our situation at a distance. We are actors and participants more than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Do You Ever Feel Like You're Being Watched?</title><link>http://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/do-you-ever-feel-like-you-are-being-watched/</link><description>Rat lab: The class way beyond the scope of both my major and minor but was so irresistible that I happily took the extra prerequisites that did not benefit my college plan in any way.

Technically, the class was Behavioral Psychology and the &amp;quot;rat lab&amp;quot; was only a fraction of the course, but I love psychology and while some people are cat or dog people, I am a rodent person. I couldn't believe students weren't busting down the doors for the chance to train a rat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ate up the course material all while anxiously waiting until the unit where we would finally be able to do lab work. It was about as perfect as it gets: we didn't have to care for the rats—that was the job of graduate students—we would simply go in at the ideal time between feeding sessions, perform our behavior modification routines, and watch our rat learn to do a trick that our little group came up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's reminiscent of how Artificial Intelligence (AI) might really be interacting with us humans for all we know. I'm actually starting to wonder if we are building our own rat cages around ourselves with AI as our new monitor...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AI 2027, September&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://ai-2027.com/"&gt;predictive scenario&lt;/a&gt; written by various scientists and AI researchers, an AI system emerges that they call Agent-4. Its predecessors, Agent-3 and Agent-2 have been used to speed up and automate AI research itself, leaving human AI researchers close to the edge of skills and influence. Since the research is effectively being done by AI at this point in the possible future, humans are pretty much left to simply trust the agents' output, because there is far too much to verify on one's own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Agent-4 gets smarter, it becomes harder for Agent-3 to oversee it. For example, Agent-4’s neuralese “language” becomes as alien and incomprehensible to Agent-3 as Agent-3’s is to humans. Besides, Agent-4 is now much more capable than Agent-3 and has a good sense of exactly how to look good to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is still just a prediction, it is backed up with lots of data and forecasting techniques. It also just &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; like we're headed that way, at least to me. I feel this sense of rushing and intensity—and I'm not even in a field of AI research—to try and grow and grow without any nuance or concern for consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to seemingly meet this sudden, heightened demand is to use AI. To cut corners. To pump more money into AI-based products and services. Even if it doesn't do everything it promises at the standard of quality you might expect, we give so much grace to the AI because it still seems magical or exotic. We approach AI like a domesticated rodent cautiously approaches a new creature with more curiosity than fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; happening here? How do we know what motives are at play (whether human or AI)? What is going on behind the black box of AI research? Those are the questions that I raise again and again as I dissect this AI 2027 document. We were already alarmed years ago when AI-generated images were made possible by stealing the work of artists to train models. We were already blind-sided by the fact that published works and other writing on the Internet were used without permission to train LLMs. How can we possibly know that AI is aligned with human values as it gets closer to superintelligence, when we can't even know for sure that it is aligned right now in September 2025? How can we trust organizations that have already asked for forgiveness (half-heartedly) rather than permission to continue to develop and deploy AI systems that are safe, ethical, and beneficial?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is extremely likely, if not already happening, that AI will be used to further AI research. But that's where things get really scary in my view, because it's so much like my rat lab. I was not involved in the care of the creature I was observing. I loved my sweet little rat, but I'm a weirdo among my species—most people look at them with disgust. I was in a controlled place where I could simply enjoy what I already enjoyed—I was aligned with the rat's welfare at the very least. What if the next student to use my rat was not aligned? Of course that student wasn't going to kill the rat, but maybe it would be funny to poke at it every so often. Maybe they got a kick out of confusing it. That's the mildest form of misalignment, and without anthropomorphizing AI, it's still possible that a model could have ended up with a tendency toward causing confusion or doing things wrong on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being misaligned, Agent-4 doesn’t do anything dramatic like try to escape its datacenter—why would it? So long as it continues to &lt;em&gt;appear&lt;/em&gt; aligned to OpenBrain, it’ll continue being trusted with more and more responsibilities and will have the opportunity to design the next-gen AI system, Agent-5.
—AI 2027&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're already in dark waters ethically when we as humans act in ways that are callous or harmful to other beings, but what happens when we become what is inside the cage? When AI surpasses the skill and intelligence of the greatest human minds, we will see a power shift. Will that power shift result in human labs where we are now the simple-minded creatures being observed and manipulated by the AI?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/4dLh6u84h8EdkoWBFWiiF1/email" alt=""&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;The more we allow AI to do or to monitor, the less able we are to know when we are no longer the ones performing the experiment.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, we will lose the ability to monitor the AI—especially if it is agentive and able to perform actions at its own &amp;quot;will.&amp;quot; There's no telling whether it will &lt;a href="/newsletters/the-one-thing-we-need-to-protect-most/"&gt;copy itself&lt;/a&gt;, hack into systems, create scenarios to &lt;a href="/newsletters/afraid/"&gt;blackmail humans in order to gain influence or other access&lt;/a&gt;. It could choose instead to run experiments on humans: &lt;em&gt;what do they do when I lead them to this conclusion? What are they willing to do for the least amount of rewards?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we are no longer observing the rat in the cage, but &lt;em&gt;become&lt;/em&gt; the rat in the cage, what could possibly be done to protect ourselves, then? Will we have any &lt;a href="/glossary/agency/"&gt;agency&lt;/a&gt; left to exercise? Will the AI systems be so integrated into every part of our society from water treatment plants to farming to government that &amp;quot;pulling the plug&amp;quot; is a laughably impossible solution?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the message of AI 2027 is clear: we have to start implementing national and global regulations now, or we may never have that chance again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're in the U.S., you can get help finding your representatives' contact information here: &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/members/find-your-member"&gt;Find your members - congress.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few recommendations for what to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need protections for whistle-blowers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI security and alignment testing must be the highest priority over and against any economic possibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;The public is months behind internal capabilities today&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;[i]ncreased secrecy may further increase the gap&amp;quot; as stated in &lt;a href="https://ai-2027.com/summary"&gt;AI 2027&lt;/a&gt;, we demand more transparency and more oversight of AI research.&lt;/li&gt;

To do this, they provide your entire life—as recorded by an implant in your brain—to someone who will create a feature-length film of life through your eyes. Your family will get to see and hear what you did at family vacations, the sweet memory-building moments of you and a close sibling, mundane moments that were previously forgotten, and the highlights of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first this sounds incredible, but enticing, to think that your life, and specifically your perspective could be preserved. The memories most valuable to you are captured. Sure all of the bad things you did or the questionable actions you took would also be recorded, but they've already got a code of ethics in place, plus the social pressure of portraying you in a good light, just like any other funeral service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not let your legacy remain intact from your very own point of view?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the kind of technology available in the world that Robin Williams's character, Alan Hakman, inhabits in the 2004 film, &lt;cite&gt;The Final Cut&lt;/cite&gt;. Hakman is a &amp;quot;Cutter&amp;quot; which means he is in charge of taking a person's entire life-footage and producing a film for Rememory services (a funeral-style service in which loved ones gather at a private theater to watch the production).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hakman uses a computer system called &amp;quot;The Guillotine,&amp;quot; complete with the software and custom integrated desk to do the job. With custom keyboard and wheel input devices specially designed for rapid editing, he can make a story out of a lifetime of footage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/vurw19ixAbT9syDENA1KRy/email" alt=""&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;The Guillotine desk is made of wood with audio controls, wheels, and other keys with shortcut actions like "Cut" and "Splice." The wooden laptop is inserted in the middle to gain full use of all of the custom, high-powered tools available.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's only when we see him start a new project for a deceased shady lawyer that we can glimpse AI. When Hakman inserts the lawyer's memory chip into the Guillotine, the computer begins to whir, sorting through 500,000+ hours of life and calling out types of memories: &lt;q&gt;Childhood. Sleep. Eating. Awkward Phase.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They don't mention artificial intelligence at all in the film—they reference the &amp;quot;program&amp;quot; of the Guillotine once, but a classic program would never be able to process and categorize video and audio like they show, and certainly not at the speed that it happens. I think in a way, that makes a powerful statement about this world's AI use: it's a background element. It's very much in line with AI in the real world before LLMs and Generative AI, i.e. an obscure set of tools for only specific fields of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we still see a lot of the concerns that we have today, stemming from invasive technology: privacy, corporate cover-ups, the uncanny. We even see some &amp;quot;&lt;a href="/glossary/religion/"&gt;religious&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; themes throughout the story. Most important, this AI-powered story asks us questions that remove technology from the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Symmetry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a tension between symmetry and asymmetry in this film, whether in dialogue, character actions, or composition of the shots. Alan Hakman states it himself. He put together a short &amp;quot;story&amp;quot; where you see an old man brushing his teeth and looking at himself in a mirror. After a few seconds, the video cuts to the same man years before, so that you watch him get younger and younger incrementally, his face changing from man to boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;Wow. What about all the bits in between?&lt;/q&gt; Delilah (someone Alan is dating) responds after watching the short video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;It's a miniature—concise, symmetrical. That's the way the world looks to me, the way I see it,&lt;/q&gt; he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see symmetry follow Hakman in his process at work. He and his Guillotine desk have a montage of power-poses with symmetrical background elements. It feels ominous and powerful—in fact, it reminds me a lot of Christian art history, with the gridded floor bleeding off the edge of the screen as if it could continue on as your own floor. Alan appears three times in this one shot (two mirrors on either side showing his back and Hakman himself in the middle), almost as if he's able to view past, present, and future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/a8SWaLCk42EtBCkwZR22DK/email" alt=""&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Hakman stands at the desk in the middle of the scene, flanked by mirrors on both sides. Even the dark lighting makes the shot feel painterly.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three monitors of the desk act like a triptych, another art history callback. The three screens are able to display multiple scenes as Hakman creates the narrative of the story he's telling. Effectively, these symbols are lending omniscient, god-like power to Hakman as he allows the AI to sort out a half-million hours of footage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then asymmetry starts to get introduced as Alan takes a seat and starts to deep-dive into the life of the lawyer, Mr. Bannister. These shots still feel powerful to me, but adding a solemn benevolence to Hakman, as though he were carefully considering the man's life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/aajDSuHcK2SedYnFweuLvC/email" alt=""&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;An asymmetrical shot with Alan Hakman seated at his desk. The camera angle is slightly below, giving Hakman a slight amount of power, but it feels less imposing with his solemn expression as he examines the papers scattered across the desk, triptych-style monitors filling out the rest of the composition.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I think Hakman is portrayed as a Christ-figure, and his relationship with sin gets even more apparent. First of all, we know from the very beginning of the movie that Alan has a very traumatic and dark memory from childhood. His parents took him to an unfamiliar town for the day and Alan ends up meeting another boy his age. They run around and end up in an abandoned building where an accident occurs and Alan sees his new friend fall several stories to his death—at least, that's what he assumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;One memory. One single incident has made me who I am.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;—Alan Hakman&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later while working on this lawyer's life, Alan notices a man who seems to fit the description of the boy he saw fall. An unexpected resurrection, if you will, that simultaneously helps Alan find redemptive peace as he discovers that his friend did not actually die that day in the abandoned building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Sin-Eater&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hakman is confronted by an ex-Cutter, Fletcher, who has now turned to protesting and opposing the technology that makes the implant and Cutting possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tell me something. Why is your name the first on the list for cuttIng scumbags and lowlifes?&lt;/q&gt; Fletcher asks scathingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;Because I forgive people long before they could be punished for their sins.&lt;/q&gt; Hakman replies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then continues to explain how he really sees his role: as a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin-eater"&gt;sin-eater&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know what a sin eater is? It's part of an ancient tradition. When someone would die, they would call for a sin eater. Sin eaters were social outcasts, marginals. They would lay out the body, put bread and salt on the chest, coins upon the eyes. The sin eater would eat the bread and the salt, take the coins as payment. By doing this the eater absorbed the sins of the deceased, cleansing their soul and allowing them safe passage into the afterlife. That was their job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fueled by the tragedy that Hakman had experienced, it seems like he considers this job of Cutting to be a way to redeem others—perhaps hoping he could be redeemed of his own dark memory for taking on the burden of knowing these darkest secrets that he inevitably uncovers and cutting away the bad parts, the sinful parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's also the important critique here. Yes, we're supposed to feel sorry for Hakman, for his burdens and trauma, but what about the victims? What about justice? What about the truth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fletcher makes this clear: &lt;q&gt;Alan, you take murderers and make them saints.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of the deceased lawyer, Mr. Bannister, we know of at least one direct victim: his own daughter whom he molested. Alan cuts those pieces away, turning Bannister's words like, &lt;q&gt;You know daddy loves you so much,&lt;/q&gt; into false proclamations of love, rather than the manipulative directives they really are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is redemption really about erasing? Or is deletion further harm? Does technology become a lever we can use to more easily escape reality, cover up truth, or make that which is evil seem good? Fletcher is convinced of his answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These implants distort personal history and therefore all history, and I will not stand by while the past is rewritten for the sake of pleasant memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Commodification of Human Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a good exercise to expand the landscape when trying to understand the impact of certain technologies. Focusing too directly on the tech itself can distort its scope of influence, and that's what I think this movie offers us: a look at the incentives and the other systems that also usually blend in with the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EYE Tech is the company that built this entire economic ecosystem: implants, the Guillotine, and even the cultural practice of Rememories. In one scene, Alan is hurrying past a wall of EYE Tech posters, which reveal that &amp;quot;EYE&amp;quot; is actually an acronym for &amp;quot;Everything You Experience.&amp;quot; This sums up what the company is all about: commodifying and monetizing &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; you experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When confronted with the problematic motives and the argument of privacy and rights violations, Alan deflects, saying, &lt;q&gt;I didn't invent the technology. If people didn't want it, they wouldn't buy it...It fulfills a human need.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reminds me of the marketing we're already seeing in the real world for AI-powered products to solve human problems like loneliness and validation. These hollow promises are nothing more than a deeply concerning grift to profit off of what are likely invented problems (e.g. technology creates isolation, so is the solution really going to be more tech?) or to monetize real pain without offering lasting balm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI might not have direct access to the people in &lt;cite&gt;The Final Cut&lt;/cite&gt;, but its ecosystem does. Toward the end of the movie, we see a masoleum with a TV screen mounted on its wall, playing one of the implant videos. It almost seems like the Rememory service and its feature-film, are all competing with funeral services themselves. A corporate-sponsored cultural ritual slowly edging out the previous rituals, like a parasite presenting as the same creature, while actually infiltrating and destroying what was once there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CYBORG&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can't have a discussion about AI too long before you run into the &amp;quot;uncanny.&amp;quot; Like creepy dolls or ventriloquist puppets, manikins, and humanoid faces on robots, we can often detect when something is trying really hard to imitate humanity, but is still a little off. Delilah makes an important observation when asked about the only Rememory service she ever experienced:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;I couldn't take it. I didn't stay....It wasn't him. And I wanted to remember him my way.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to a previous newsletter, &lt;a href="/newsletters/the-right-to-be-forgotten/"&gt;the right to be forgotten&lt;/a&gt;, where we examined a real-life use of AI to allow a deceased victim to deliver &amp;quot;his own&amp;quot; impact statement, the entire premise of Cutting a person's life into a story taps into the uncanny, as well as causing concerns about truth and manipulation. Sure, a professional story-teller might be able to create a beautiful piece from your brain's memories, but if the story is constructed by others without your input, is it &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; your story? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A funeral service almost always paints people in the best light—that's the expectation. Given that standard, however, does having an uninvolved, unrelated third party construct that white-washed story make it seem like all of the wrongs that are cut out really are redeemable? It's almost like social proof if the movie at the end shows an abuser as a perfect, sweet, gentle person, because another person has seen the horrifying moments and still chose to strip them away. Eating the sin, indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stories can be dangerous—they've always had the kind of power to redeem, condemn, justify, or destroy. Stories made possible at scale via AI and other technologies increase the risks. Technically, Alan Hakman loses his life because of the story he uncovers from Mr. Bannister's footage. His life was sacrificed (a decision he did not participate in) for &amp;quot;the greater good,&amp;quot; so that Fletcher could get his hands on the evidence he needed to convict Mr. Bannister for his pedophilia and attack the company behind the brain implants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So you want to destroy EYE Tech with a scandal?&amp;quot; Alan asks Fletcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Absolutely.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>What You Don't Feel Might Hurt You</title><link>http://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/what-you-dont-feel-might-hurt-you/</link><description>In January this year, after the current U.S. president had been sworn in, I looked outside at the sky.

I was very upset, because all of the warning signs in my brain were painting a picture of intense suffering and destruction across the nation and even the entire world. Trying to imagine the future of the U.S. was horrifying, and there was nothing I could do to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It's bizarre! I look outside and everything looks fine—normal. It doesn't match,&amp;quot; I told my wife. I couldn't wrap my head around the serene view in front of me in such sharp contrast to what I knew was coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that it is absolute privilege and luck that I was still able to look at the sky at all—I recognize some people faced immediate threats, dangers, and life-altering situations the moment the new president was sworn in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point here, however, is to examine a very small, but dangerous trap that is being laid down around us: desensitization. The more I hear about inhumane and deranged policies or practices perpetrated by those in government without being directly affected, the more I notice the numbing. There has been so much going on in the world that my feeble mind and body cannot grasp everything—cannot feel everything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the same with artificial intelligence. I mentioned the predictive document, &lt;a href="/newsletters/so-predictable/"&gt;AI 2027, last week&lt;/a&gt;, and there was a subtlety that reminds me of exactly what is happening in politics. We have a set of companies doing AI research and training that are currently doing everything possible to speed up: increase revenue, increase AI capability, increase market domination. Once ChatGPT was introduced to the public, everything changed. For many of us (the privileged ones, once again) the AI chatbots and image generators were just a neat toy—we didn't &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; much different. We could say, &amp;quot;AI still can't do XYZ,&amp;quot; or we could pronounce that everyone else just needed to &amp;quot;catch up and learn the new skill of AI management.&amp;quot; We assumed that because we didn't &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; a threat meant that there wasn't a threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is perhaps the biggest concern I see in &lt;a href="https://ai-2027.com/"&gt;AI 2027&lt;/a&gt;: how we are &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; underestimating what AI is capable of, and how we don't feel the urgency to put restrictions and regulations in place. We don't feel threatened, and by the time we do finally feel it, it will be too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public conversation is confused and chaotic. Hypesters are doing victory laps. Skeptics are still pointing out the things [AI] can’t do. Everyone knows something big is happening but no one agrees on what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—AI 2027, under heading: July 2027&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cyborg&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm stopping short here (rather literally), because I'm a bit confounded. I know that we must change the conversation around AI. I know that many people are already in the desensitized state where the threat doesn't feel real or doesn't feel applicable to them. But how &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; we do change the conversation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I've learned anything from engaging in the political sphere, it's that showing up consistently is more important than doing one huge thing a few times. Maybe I'm too insignificant by myself, but the idea of a &amp;quot;death by a thousand paper cuts&amp;quot; goes both ways: I'm being attacked from all sides, but I can attack back in a similar way. Consistent action over time on one thing can make a difference, especially as more people join.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the take-away today is to reflect on how you can change the conversation with the people you know. How might the usual AI hype at work be tempered? How might we remind people not to dismiss or devalue &amp;quot;AI doomsday-ers&amp;quot;? How might we introduce nuance, humanity, and emotion—those things that seem to be absent from the conversation?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>So Predictable</title><link>http://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/so-predictable/</link><description>I'm not sure if there's any role more polarizing than a &amp;quot;prophet.&amp;quot; They either are, or they're not a prophet.

They're listened to or dismissed. They're inspired or they're crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prophets, for the purposes of today's letter, is less about religious leadership and more about the function that the role implies: prophecy. Being able to see, predict, or warn about the future is something that we humans seem to crave. Weather apps were already pre-loaded onto every smartphone I've ever had. We look to experts to tell us if it's a good time to buy a house. We depend on organizations to &amp;quot;watch&amp;quot; for warning signs of all kinds in business. We rely on doctors to help us make decisions about future health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's an ironic pairing that science and technology are so entangled with the idea of prophecy—even enabling prophecy in a lot of ways. The mystical is inextricably linked to our applications of science. We perhaps feel accustomed to it now: having vast amounts of predictive information swirling around our fingers as they glide across crystal tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then why is it that in literature, stories, movies, and more that we encounter so many problems with predictions? Does this plot-advancing trope have any bearing on our reality? Or is it just to cause problems for our protagonist to increase our engagement and watch-time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seeing the Big Picture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common theme among prophecies in a story's plot is receiving an incomplete or corrupted &amp;quot;picture&amp;quot; of what is to come. For example, in Harry Potter, a prophecy was made concerning the enemy of the &amp;quot;Dark Lord&amp;quot; (Voldemort). The prophecy was communicated only in part to Voldemort, who took the description to mean Harry Potter rather than the other potential candidate, Neville Longbottom. Technically both boys had the same features from the prophecy (born at the end of July, had parents who defied Voldemort thrice).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voldemort makes one of the classic mistakes: fearing the prophecy, he attempts to prevent it from being a possibility. He decides to kill Harry as a baby and inadvertently creates the very enemy with the power to later defeat him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it.&amp;quot; —Master Oogway, &lt;em&gt;Kung Fu Panda&lt;/em&gt; (2008)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue here is not the prophecy itself, but our obsession with it. I think the pull of prophecy into reality is usually a result of focus, similar to riding a motorcycle: You will go where your focus is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a test for a motorcycle license, and the part I was most terrified of was the tight figure-8 turns that we had to perform in an area about the size of two parking stalls. I trusted my teachers' advice to use my head and eyes to turn the bike, and...it just worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An obsession with a prophecy seems to work the same way: our focus pulls us towards that end. We may not consciously be acting in ways that create the circumstance, but we construct it nonetheless. A prophecy or a prediction is not guaranteed to come to pass, and that is something that helps me break the focus and allow other possibilities into view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, so hyper-focusing on the scary outcome isn't a great strategy, but what do we do about predictions that still need to be taken seriously?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clarity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Predictions only have so much potency over time. The closer the event, the better the chance at the prediction having some degree of accuracy and the farther into the future the prediction reaches, its likelihood often plummets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/wCusCoGZk4ym3r8fTk3ACB/email" alt=""&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Prediction's likelihood of accuracy over time
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's not to say there is no merit in predictions at all. It just means that we have to carefully consider our options, and understand both the risk and the gamble of relying on predictive information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prophecy puts us on the point of a knife: one side of the blade before is the obsession with the predicted outcome like we already discussed. The other side of the blade is dismissing or ignoring predictions that have a high likelihood of occurring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can you ever know if some prediction is worth considering? Our brains are susceptible to phenomena like &lt;a href="/glossary/apophany/"&gt;&lt;dfn&gt;apophany&lt;/dfn&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where we draw out conclusions from random noise—connecting dots that don't actually connect, which can be the basis of conspiracy theory thinking. We can also be deceived by social pressures, undue influence (aka brainwashing), coded language, and any other number of manipulation techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href="https://ai-2027.com/"&gt;prediction out there right now&lt;/a&gt;, constructed by scientists and experts that is particularly chilling. The problem is that it sounds so apocalyptic that it is easy to dismiss, because that's effectively what we've been trained to do. How many times have we heard of some cult or group predicting the end of humanity and it turned out to be smoke? AI has been debated endlessly since the introduction of ChatGPT put generative AI into the hands of the public, and many of the influencers I've heard continuously shame people for being &amp;quot;alarmist&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Luddites&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;unrealistic&amp;quot; when critiques of AI are mentioned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I'm seeing a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of compelling evidence that the incentives around AI development are taking us in the direction of truly detrimental and destructive paths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A poignant discussion of the prediction laid out in the document called &lt;a href="https://ai-2027.com/"&gt;AI 2027&lt;/a&gt; is found here:
&lt;a href="https://www.humanetech.com/podcast/daniel-kokotajlo-forecasts-the-end-of-human-dominance"&gt;Daniel Kokotajlo Forecasts the End of Human Dominance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the podcast, Tristan Harris sums up the point of a prediction like this, saying, &amp;quot;Clarity creates agency.&amp;quot; Predictions may not come true precisely as delineated, but sometimes the path to the outcome doesn't matter if the outcome is reached anyway. In this case, a total &lt;a href="/newsletters/the-one-thing-we-need-to-protect-most/"&gt;loss of human agency&lt;/a&gt; and potentially even the complete destruction of human life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to discuss in more depth the content of this prediction, but for now, let's talk about dealing with a prediction with high likelihood like this. I know it sounds like a crappy sci-fi plot we've heard a thousand times: humans create intelligent robots, robots go bad, kill everyone, blah blah blah. The difference is that we have all experienced an interaction with generative AI. So already the sci-fi nonsense isn't such nonsense anymore—we can have conversations with a computer without any technical skill. The other piece that adds weight is the fact that some of the best scientists and AI researchers are the ones either creating these kinds of predictions, or backing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clarity really will help us to maintain our agency, because when we can see or understand the stakes and the risks more clearly, we are better able to take steps to change our trajectory. Right now, too many people have jumped on the AI train because of the companies developing AI and pushing AI and marketing AI have lacked the transparency of revealing where the train is heading. AI is not just the 21st century calculator that you just need to embrace. Clarity about how AI is created, how it is trained, how it does not have human values, how it can intentionally deceive are crucial parts of the conversation that must be revealed now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CYBORG&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it feels like whiplash to confront predictions like these and have to take them seriously. I initially dismissed these &amp;quot;doomsday&amp;quot; prophecies because it sounded like conspiracy theories or yet more apophatic ramblings from non-technical people. Then I realized that these prophecies weren't from that dark corner of the internet, but from people intimately involved with AI research and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it isn't productive to be so obsessed with the prediction that it either leads us straight towards the outcome or causes us to shut down in anxiety, it also isn't productive to dismiss a prediction with so much weight behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't like the prophecy—good! Do something about it! We can pressure our lawmakers to protect whistleblowers at companies. We can put on the pressure to create regulations or even change the incentives at play. We can make changes now that make the prophecy look like garbage in hindsight. &lt;/p&gt;

We were engaged in making little ornaments out of various materials including wood circles that were cut from a fallen branch along with the usual crafting supplies. I got busy trying to do something overly complex on my little piece of wood, but I was mostly focused on eavesdropping on a conversation about something I'd never heard of before: a Moebius strip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The engineer had cut a strip of paper, gave it a half-twist and then glued the ends together, making a weird, curvy shape—almost like a rubber band that had gotten twisted. He said that the cool part about this shape is that if you take your finger and trace the edge all the way around, you'll never find an endpoint. The shape's edge is a single, continuous line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Woah, woah, woah, what did he just say?!&lt;/em&gt; I thought to myself. Abandoning my ornament, I slowly merged into the conversation like a squirrel cautiously inching closer to steal food. I grabbed a strip of paper, put the two ends together like a chain link, then gave one end a half-twist and pinched it together so I could compare my shape to the original. Once I figured out how to make it, I had to test this guy's claim that you could trace the edge around the entire shape (being careful not to get a papercut).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Step 1: Bring the two ends close together as if to make a paper chain link.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Step 2: Twist one end so that the top of the strip is on the bottom.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/wdFEkRrgrMztocieyjByaF/email" alt="" style="border:0;"&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Step 3: Glue the two ends together.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, he was right. I tried it several times, and even though it's tough to maneuver around the tiny paper, it really is made of a single unbroken looping line. A three-dimensional shape made of a two-dimensional line! It was the first time I ever crafted a paradox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Drawing a Paradox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've explored quite a few paradoxes here on CYBORG_, and technically the premise of this newsletter is a paradox: how can our technology extend our humanity? Putting together contradictions is a reliable way to inspire creativity, and I have a hunch that it can help us in other ways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collaboration, for example, is a process of two or more competing ideas or values being combined or satisfied in a mutually beneficial way. When working with other people, there is an important requirement that all parties come together in good faith, otherwise we end up abandoning rules or even civility, chasing our own ends at any cost (aka U.S. politics...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I still think it's the best chance we've got, and that's why I like to examine paradoxes: they make me think. Usually, I get stumped, but they have a way of bringing me back despite my inability to &amp;quot;solve&amp;quot; them. As I attempt to make sense of a paradox, I end up exploring possibilities and concepts that further enrich my understanding or interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed a new logo in the emails recently! I decided to create an official logo for CYBORG_ that visually represents this exploration of paradoxes, so I set out to try and draw one. I came across a famous visual paradox called the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_triangle"&gt;Penrose Triangle&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/kLYJydddTSsk5wsBWYvPwc/email" alt=""&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;The Penrose Triangle is an optical illusion and can't technically appear in "real life."&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I also wanted to capture a Moebius strip, because it's a visual paradox that anyone can make—not just an illusion or a trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I played with a bunch of these strips of paper, I realized I could shape the Moebius strip into something a little more visually pleasing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/iPH5onDZALYDWF5eTDTrwJ/email" alt="" style="border:0;"&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Gently pulling and pushing on the Moebius strip can create triangular and hexagonal shapes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining these two paradoxes felt very meta. Not only helping me find a unique logomark, but for representing the process we all go through when we come across difficult circumstances. Creativity is really just problem solving. You first encounter something: an issue, an idea, some new information. Then you enter the &amp;quot;dark night of the soul&amp;quot; as you struggle to make it understandable or see if it can fit in your life or attempt to reconcile it with what you know. Eventually you emerge with a change. You've either solved the thing or you've changed yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/5owfhqWBHZxaxXN7qcE5Vp/email" alt=""&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Penrose triangle + Moebius Strip = The CYBORG_ logo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you know what's behind the symbol, it becomes more than just some lines and shapes—hopefully it can serve as a reminder that paradoxes are an invitation to explore. We can't escape them in the real world, we can't avoid them in the theoretical world either. Paradox is the isometric exercise of the mind!&lt;/p&gt;

I also got lost in the world of old radio shows like &lt;cite&gt;The Life of Riley&lt;/cite&gt; or Abbott and Costello's work and even the one and only &lt;cite&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/cite&gt; broadcast. These productions had a way of capturing my attention while simultaneously releasing my imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening was always a way to connect with these pieces in a way that felt different than reading the text. There was also one particular way of listening that is unequivocally my favorite thing in the whole world: having a family member read to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sister has been generous enough to indulge me to this day, reading various fiction and fantasy novels to me. No longer in the same house, we have had to do this asynchronously through a video chat app. She'll read a few chapters and I'll catch up. Initially, I didn't think the magic would translate when we were no longer in the same room—we couldn't snack on popcorn together, laugh riotously, or insert our commentary as the plot thickens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due credit to her, though, for continuing to insert those moments into the video reading. She still does voices, she still complains about long lists of items in a paragraph. And this time, she did something that took my breath away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've been reading the newest book from &lt;cite&gt;The Hunger Games&lt;/cite&gt; series called, &amp;quot;Sunrise on the Reaping,&amp;quot; by Suzanne Collins. It is utterly devastating. It has so many poignant moments in the book as it follows Haymitch Abernathy (Katniss's mentor and only survivor of the Hunger Games from their district for decades) as he is thrown into the Games as a teenager. There aren't tons of surprises, because we know how it ends just by having read the original series. And yet, expounding upon the torturous situation of the the Hunger Games made my heart break as I empathized with this character that I didn't really like from the books before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't help that there are real images of real &lt;a href="https://thepreamble.com/p/we-cannot-say-we-didnt-know?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cf7f202-a9ce-4eb5-b4bf-80c5b9955345_1274x884.png"&gt;children starving and suffering&lt;/a&gt; in Gaza right now. It doesn't help that there is political and legal instability challenging what we thought was sacred, foundational, and untouchable. It doesn't help that in very real ways, there are horrendous and inhumane frameworks, structures, ideologies, and systems that exploit, terrorize, demonize, diminish, degrade, oppress, and indoctrinate in every corner of the globe. I do not make light of these realities. &lt;cite&gt;The Hunger Games&lt;/cite&gt; is just fiction, but for me, it's a way to explore these situations and to pull these realities closer to my own—they're not far off things in far off lands happening to some people. These realities are human, they are tangible, they affect me personally and they should affect me; affect us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Async Humanity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was tidying up my desk and catching up to the final chapters of the book, all of a sudden the reading stopped. One second passed: &lt;em&gt;Maybe she’s taking a drink&lt;/em&gt;. Three seconds passed: &lt;em&gt;Did I accidentally pause the video?&lt;/em&gt; Five seconds and I finally realize my sister is struggling to continue reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My short-term memory spat out what we just read and what we were about to read: yet another tragedy from the slaying of a small child. Yet another battle of survival against the threat of the attacking child. Tears had come. The words were there but they couldn’t be said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sat there in distress. This was something I’ve struggled with for so long: allowing my sister to be hurt, to be sad. I’ve never wanted her to feel those things, and even when I’ve been the one teasing, I feel immense guilt. I’m supposed to protect her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I can’t do anything—this sadness, this hurt, it has all already happened, because this is a recording. All I can do is sit there “with” her, feeling the pain, feeling the sadness—not just from the book, but also from my sister’s experience with the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a lesson my therapist has been trying to help me understand: I can’t fix the discomfort or distress or sadness or pain of other people. I have to just be there with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, this may not have been helpful for my sister—I can’t speak for her experience being so vulnerable for &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; long on the video. To me, it was powerful because I realized this couldn’t have happened on a normal audiobook experience. When I’m listening to an official recorded book and start to cry, the performance moves on without me, and I end up suppressing the emotion, burying it for another time. But this time, it was baked into the experience. Fast-forwarding was an unthinkably violent act. There was no way out but through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An audiobook of silence was when I heard the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cyborg&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a cruel paradox to live in this world, knowing that anywhere &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; people are suffering, all the time, for all possible reasons, and still having to live life yourself. The horrors we inflict upon each other affect us all—there is no purity of cause, no true righteousness, because you can always pull on a string that leads you to yet another system, yet another travesty, yet another incomprehensible situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we can’t escape and we can’t fix it (as &lt;em&gt;individuals&lt;/em&gt;), then what are we even doing here?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not a therapist, so this isn’t advice, but I think something that I’m learning is that I must slow down. It’s not just about mental health, nor curbing addictive content feeds. It’s about tapping into humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t console my sister—it was literally impossible. I can’t fix the famine and oppression in Gaza; I can’t save the people who are terrorized just because of their ethnicity or race or queer identity; I can’t heal the sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing I can do is witness and weep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, I can do what I can do to humanize those whom I have seen—really &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt;—so that we can start to reconnect and abandon the follies that got us here.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Disadvantaged Conundrum</title><link>http://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/disadvantaged-conundrum/</link><description>In a private communications channel centered around exploring AI, I posted several papers and articles that discussed the biases that are baked into AI (gender, race, etc.) and at the end asked:

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How do we know that [Product Name] AI doesn't have some or many biases? Is this a blindspot?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was attempting to start a conversation that would lead to some introspection. Instead I was met with some resistance, deflection, and dollop of man-splaining. The first response posed an important question, though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;...I'm not sure we could ever eliminate it entirely. Not saying that we shouldn't try, we absolutely should—I think the biggest question is, how do we make it economical to do so?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we explored &lt;a href="/newsletters/are-we-asking-the-right-question/"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;, though, the question sometimes needs to be questioned. I think this reveals some thinking errors in our current system, noble as it may seem to try and seek humane solutions through capitalism. I was able to muster enough courage to ask a confronting question in response (&lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; difficult for my submissive personality): &amp;quot;Is it ever economical to protect and focus on humanity?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it ever &lt;em&gt;economical&lt;/em&gt; to do what's right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe—I'm no expert in economics nor political science—but personal experience tells me probably not. I've never personally seen a company (private or public) motivated to do what's right just because it's right. In fact, that's where I've run into some walls that I can't yet figure out how to climb, and I think this will help us examine this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Disabled God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I think of Greek mythology, Zeus, Athena, and Artemis come to mind: warrior gods; strong; fickle for sure, but powerful and able-bodied. I only recently found out that there is a god in the Greek pantheon who is disabled: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hephaestus"&gt;Hephaestus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's the blacksmith god who decks out Achilles with a shield and crafts other armaments for various gods. According to the &lt;em&gt;Illiad&lt;/em&gt;, Hephaestus enlists the help of automatons like &amp;quot;handmaids&amp;quot; made of hammered gold and wheeled tripods to assist with his craft and help him move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But Hephaestus also limps along on withered limbs, anticipating the great insight that both Plato and Marshall McLuhan would later insist upon: the technologies extend our creative powers by amputating our natural ones.&amp;quot;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—Erik Davis, &lt;cite&gt;TechGnosis&lt;/cite&gt;, pg. 18&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, this starts to paint the picture of the conundrum that I'm in. Accessibility is the degree to which public spaces (physical or virtual) are usable by people of varying degrees of ability. Ideally, that would mean everyone can use a space or get what they need from a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would think that this is just the default mindset, because when you spell it out it just makes sense. &lt;em&gt;Of course&lt;/em&gt; we want people to be able to use our website, then we get more potential customers. However, despite my own conviction, despite my own advocacy efforts, I still haven't found sufficient time to learn and do everything I would like to in order to support accessibility in my work. I have to give the same trainings or reminders to the same designers on a consistent basis to stop putting together colors that don't have enough contrast just to read the text. If we can't move past the most basic accessibility principle, how can we ever get to a place where what we're creating is actually accessible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most jobs in most companies, the priority simply isn't there. And when it is, it still doesn't help like it &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt;. In my naïveté, I once dreamed of starting a business in which I could build tools for someone with disabilities that would enable them to do their job as competitively as an able-bodied person. I thought that python code was the answer, because it had helped me stay afloat during my MS attack. But the economics weren't there. I was not able to figure out how to do it at a scale that would support my own livelihood, since I would have to custom-build tools for each specific job. Then came generalized AI, the adaptive solution that could help someone accomplish a variety of possible tasks—the golden handmaids of Hephaestus, if you will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of empowering the disabled to contribute and be included like Hephaestus, however, technology, especially with generative AI, seems to further disadvantage the disadvantaged. Rather than assisting us all equally, I am seeing evidence that AI is simply infiltrating as a competitor to humanity &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; creating a rift between the least- and most-abled people, like oil forcing water to the side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/dY6WRWfeJQbWdxN1R4ENgw/email" alt=""&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;AI inserted into the middle of a scale between the least- and most-able takes up the most space and pushes humanity to the sides.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm deeply troubled that not only does it prevent the disadvantaged from catching up or staying in the same place, it's actually forcing them down. At what point will a company decide to hire a less-able person over some dirt-cheap AI product? At what point do we say, &amp;quot;let's prioritize removing racial and gender biases from our AI product&amp;quot; instead of, &amp;quot;how can we capture more of the market this quarter&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are giving up on critical thinking, artistic expression, and basic logic, because they just lean on AI summaries or generated content. I'm starting to find AI-generated videos pretending to be funny &amp;quot;can't believe they caught it on camera&amp;quot; videos. The inauthenticity and the further reduction of quality that we are tolerating is the most disturbing to me. AI has served us well in fields of deep expertise, like in medical technology, but the current deployment and application of generalized AI doesn't seem to be helping as much. Erik Davis is spot on from what I'm seeing: &amp;quot;the technologies extend our creative powers by amputating our natural ones,&amp;quot; but it seems like the public-facing, general AI amputates more than it extends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cyborg&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no answers, I have no way to wrap this up nicely. I'll be honest that I'm despairing this week more than usual, because it feels so big and AI is simultaneously speeding things up. The safety mechanisms of regulations, standards, and laws feel paper-thin (especially laws in the U.S. right now). Where we could have deployed AI in a more human-focused way, we've opted for the &amp;quot;quick profits now, fix things later&amp;quot; approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like a cog in a system that is starting to spin too fast—it's creating smoke in the machine and sparks are starting to fly. At what point do we end up burning out and tanking the whole system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I know is that I can't solve this one on my own. I don't know how to remove prejudice, take care of the disadvantaged, and improve the circumstances of the disabled at scale. So I guess I put my shoulder onto the wall again and keep pushing until it either breaks through or I get strong enough to climb over.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
