&lt;p&gt;Any new technology, any extension or amplification of human faculties when given material embodiment, tends to create a new environment...It is in the interplay between the old and the new environments that there is generated an innumerable series of problems and confusions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—&lt;em&gt;The relation of environment to anti-environment&lt;/em&gt;, Marshall McLuhan, page 6&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are creatures of our environment; both nature and nurture are features of it. We cannot escape our environments and yet, most of the time the environment seems to escape &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt;—our attention, at least. In order to make sense of our situation, our world, we have a few tools at the ready to help pull the environment out of the background noise and into our focus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we look at those tools, we need to first understand what Marshall McLuhan meant by new technologies creating new environments—and that it is largely when a new environment is created that we start to really see the old environment. Let's start with a quick example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet is just a huge file-and-folder structure linked together and stored on someone else's &amp;quot;computers.&amp;quot; This seems obvious to developer-type people, but to everyone else, that framework is entirely missed. If you happen to be a Windows user, the File Explorer makes it easier to see the connection, because it shows you the &amp;quot;path&amp;quot; (think URL) of wherever you are currently looking on your computer, just like the browser does with the URL. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A website is composed of one huge folder, a.k.a. the domain, then you can explore sub-folders as far as you can go. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://cyborgnewsletter.com/ (The big folder)&lt;br&gt;
https://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/ (the newsletters sub-folder)&lt;br&gt;
https://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/what-am-i/ (the document, &amp;quot;What Am I&amp;quot; inside the subfolder)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a little bit simplistic, but the metaphor of files and folders, stolen from the older environment of real-world files and folders, is a really solid foundation for understanding what websites really are and how they work. However, the Internet is still a new environment in my opinion, and that's likely why there's so much confusion or total blindness to the basics of websites: how they work, what they can do, how dangerous they can be, how useful they can be, how they are both simple and complex, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's an Environment?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An environment is naturally of low intensity or low definition. That is why it escapes observation. Anything that raises the environment to high intensity, whether it be a storm in nature or violent change resulting from a new technology, such high intensity turns the environment into an object of attention. When an environment becomes an object of attention, it assumes the character of an anti-environment or an art object. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—McLuhan, page 11&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McLuhan sets up two opposing concepts: the environment and the anti-environment. The artist in me wants to simplify it to &amp;quot;background&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;foreground,&amp;quot; because the background usually &amp;quot;escapes observation&amp;quot; in a painting or a drawing, while the subject in the foreground is what is calling our attention. Under this model, we can watch how technology changes how we behave and interact with the world and each other as systems either fade into the background or become inescapably noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can already start to recognize McLuhan's observation about technology and environments by looking at the Internet, again. There is a massive trend now (arguably for a decade or so) of people obsessing over physical notebooks, note-taking, and even reading. I see this as part of a response to the &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; environment of the Internet, which is hiding in plain sight as background, while the &amp;quot;old&amp;quot; environment of physical knowledge-related objects have suddenly moved into the foreground to capture our attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Watching the World Change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many things can become the background or the foreground, but McLuhan does call out that society itself cannot be the background. I think that's because there has to be a third party in the model: an observer; the attention-giver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventionally, society is always one phase back, is never environmental. Paradoxically, it is the antecedent environment that is always being upgraded for our attention. The new environment always uses the old environment as its material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—McLuhan, page 11&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like the example of websites being just a bunch of files and folders (old environment), it takes that old metaphor and remixes it into something impossible in the old environment: interactivity, scaling the access to potentially the entire globe, becoming a destination and not just a container for information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example that is even more tangible is music. McLuhan says that the music of the concert hall was anti-environment (foreground), because it was the content inside of the environment. You went to a concert hall for the purpose of hearing the music. Technology changed that game when music could be played whenever you wanted, wherever you wanted. In McLuhan's time, that probably meant vinyl records or maybe tapes. We have continued to push music into the environment as CDs, MP3 players, and online radios and libraries have been developed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these technologies, music has not only become a background—only noticed when it has stopped playing—it has also changed in the social dimension. &amp;quot;...when music becomes environmental by electric means, it becomes more and more the concern of the private individual&amp;quot; (McLuhan, pg. 13). The concert hall was a ritual for a group to participate in. The music on a tape, an MP3 player, or a smartphone is almost exclusively for a single person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what were those tools we have to lean on to help us sort through the mess of these new technologies and get some clarity on where we currently are?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Enemy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The artist as a maker of anti-environment permits us to perceive that much is newly environmental and therefore most active in transforming situations. This would seem to be why the artist has in many circles in the past century been called the enemy, the criminal. It helps to explain why news has a natural bias toward crime and bad news. It is this kind of news that enables us to perceive our world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—McLuhan, page 11&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an artist myself, I was really intrigued by the realization that we are &amp;quot;called the enemy,&amp;quot; though my foggy memory of art history classes confirms this. Perhaps it has only been more recently that the artists have started to become heroes instead of just weirdos. The artist as enemy, to me, actually gives me more purpose than the artist as hero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in university, I felt torn between two personas: the ingenious strategist that would help businesses succeed and grow, and the outspoken voice of warning or protest. Maybe a lot of that had to do with being torn between traditional art as a major and graphic design (which I ended up choosing). The traditional artists I learned from—whether as professors or those from art history—often saw their work as saying something or being part of some huge purpose. It was common for the artists with the greatest influence to be the ones that critiqued &amp;quot;the system&amp;quot; or government or other social and cultural norms. They were the rebels, the enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own art at the time reflected my inability to see the &amp;quot;environment&amp;quot; of theses systems, which is why most of the pieces I made are utterly unremarkable. I wanted to be the hero, not the enemy. In trying so hard to fit in, to not rock the boat, to ignore what I could see, I failed to fully inhabit that role of artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an environment is new, we perceive the old one for the first time...when the Emperor appeared in his new clothes, his courtiers did not see his nudity, they saw his old clothes. Only the small child and the artist have the immediacy of approach that permits perception of the environmental. The artist provides us with anti-environments that enable us to see the environment. Such anti-environmental means of perception must constantly be renewed in order to be efficacious...in an age of accelerated change, the need to perceive the environment becomes urgent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—McLuhan, page 18&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tools that an artist uses to critique and create are the tools that are available to all of us, though it has often been the artists that assume the responsibility of helping the rest of us see. That's why I'm sticking my neck out a little bit and trying an experiment. I'm stepping into the shoes of enemy artist, and I'm creating a private art show that critiques the oppressive systems in our current environment. My goal is to generate in-person conversations about the difficult stuff we'd rather ignore or rage about anonymously online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the first time my art has meant something. It's the first time I want people to see the pieces. I'll let you know how it goes, wish me luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be continued...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S.

I am unable to pull myself away from all of the &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; movies and the new show, &lt;em&gt;Alien Earth.&lt;/em&gt; It's been puzzling me because it's been so captivating, and I think I'm seeing an interesting connection between our real world problems and my fascination with the discomfort and disgust of these horrible stories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We Used to Be Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the moments at the very beginning of the &lt;em&gt;Alien Earth&lt;/em&gt; series that gave me serious pause for reflection was this little observation from the synthetic chief scientist, Kirsh:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You used to be food, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your lives were short and filled with fear. Then your brains grew. You built tools and used them to conquer nature. You built impossible machines and went to space. You stopped being food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, I should say, you told yourself you weren't food anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the animal kingdom, there is always someone bigger or smaller who would eat you alive if they had the chance. That's what it is to be an animal. You're born. You live. You die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's chilling to think that even in this big world that we've created around us, it still doesn't shield us from nature. Rarely, that means those bigger or fiercer creatures that you could run into by chance, but maybe more often it's the nature of the micro-scale: the disease, the virus, or even systemic issues from the environment to our own bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong, at least in the wealthiest countries, we have done &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt; to improve the quality of our lives, to be able to have a relatively low infant mortality rate, to have vaccines that promote the health of communities, to be able to slow the progression of incurable diseases. And it's not enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help explain, I lean on a grotesque scene in the second episode of &lt;em&gt;Alien Earth&lt;/em&gt; (I'll spare the gory details and keep it light). A ship has crashed into a huge building on Earth, carrying several species of aliens, including the infamous xenomorph (the beautifully designed creature from the &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; franchise), which obviously escapes from the crashed spaceship to terrorize and kill everything it can find in the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rescue team is sent in to try and find any injured people from the crash and assess the scene. One medic, Joe Hermit, gets separated while being chased by the xenomorph. He manages to evade the monster and gets to the 65th floor of the building and reunites with another search party soldier. They find a room full of people dressed in Victorian garb—curly white-haired wigs, puffy sleeves, corsets and all. These are wealthy elites, sitting mindlessly at the top of their tower, complaining about all of the noise caused by the spaceship crashing into the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well I'm sure if it's a real problem, Boy Kavalier will call me personally. We belong to the same club,&amp;quot; the man the script calls &amp;quot;His Lordship&amp;quot; says as he ignores the soldier and medic's attempts at getting them to evacuate. The xenomorph conveniently reveals itself shortly after the absurd scene and lays waste to all of the foolish rich people in their fancy outfits. You can almost hear the message: Your money means nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used to be food. We decided we weren't going to be anymore. But are we really any different than how we started?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to skip this next paragraph if you don't want the image in your head, I include it for those who have seen the show:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To drive this point home even further, the episode puts up two horrible, parallel shots. The first is with the rescue crew that gets into the wrecked spaceship. They find a cat aboard that has been so badly injured that it drags itself along the floor with its two front paws. Later at the 65th floor dinner party, His Lordship is seen crawling in the same manner—legs no longer part of his body. Man and animal in precise harmony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Refuge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology has been touted for so long as a saving force. We know there is a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of Western Christian imagery and themes that are bound into our current set of technology. Tech is often talked about as if it were a serpent on a staff, raised to save those who would simply look upon it, or maybe it's the Savior figure himself: the incomprehensible solution to every problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is a scary place and nature acts as an inscrutable, impersonal, violent force. It giveth and it taketh away—then it destroyeth and decayeth. Sometimes nature &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; like an encounter with the xenomorph. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inexorable laws of nature alone will do nicely to crush my own egotistical sense of power in the world, and I don't need to read the universal uncontrollable forces as being transcendental or wholly other. This is why, I think, the biological monsters created by H.R. Giger in Ridley Scott's film &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; are so horrific: we are as helpless (at least in the first three acts) in the face of these natural selection machines as we are before any traditional deity...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—&lt;em&gt;On Monsters&lt;/em&gt;, Stephen T. Asma, 192&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this tension between the harshness of the natural world and the parallel, but at least human-made, technological world is what makes these movies and aliens so attention-grabbing to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a sense of control in our technology: I feel empowered every time I get something I've programmed working. I turn on a fan when I feel too warm in my office. I fill up my water bottle from inside my own home when I'm thirsty. These are incredible, unthinkably powerful things. I also have a disease (multiple sclerosis) that I carry with me, that may lash out at me at any unsuspecting moment. The weather can destroy my home or threaten my safety. Something as simple and tiny as a virus could kill me from within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The safety and comfort of technology surrounds me, and yet I know I'm still a vulnerable little animal at my core. That puts me on edge. It's not the ever-present potential of threat that a squirrel might experience out in the wild, it's a subtle anxiety that hides in the shadows of my thoughts: &lt;em&gt;What if?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monsters of contemporary horror are not like their medieval counterparts, who were more like God's henchman. That older paradigm held out the inevitability of monstrous defeat by divine justice, but the contemporary monster is often a reminder of theological abandonment and the accompanying angst. Nor are the more recent horror monsters like the monsters of the Enlightenment, products of human superstition that can be conquered by the light of reason. Monsters after Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and Freud are features of the irrevocable irrationality inside the human subject and outside in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;cite&gt;On Monsters&lt;/cite&gt;, 202&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cyborg&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point here is not exacerbate our anxieties, but to also try and avoid being the idiotic, clueless cos-players at the 65th floor dinner party. When we become too insulated and too used to our wealth or privilege, we become vulnerable to the surprises of nature. The fix is not to become overly anxious nor to become draconic hoarders. I think part of the fix is the opposite: gratitude and resource-sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gratitude is noticing that the water flows cleanly and reliably from the tap. Gratitude is noticing that the dark, scary, spider-filled part of the garage can be illuminated with a light switch or a flashlight. Gratitude says, &lt;em&gt;I have enough&lt;/em&gt;, then considers, &lt;em&gt;Maybe I have more than enough, and I can share&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resource-sharing is not just about your individual contributions, though of course that is valuable and impressive. When I think about the current real-life threats to modern humans, disease and AI are the biggest threats that come to mind, but I'm starting to wonder if we need more focus on disease right now. Consider these two examples from Jonathan Kennedy's excellent research:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis was another major killer in the slums of industrializing Europe, but it declined in high-income countries as living and working conditions improved, antibiotics were developed and national immunization programs were introduced in the mid-twentieth century. And yet, despite the fact that there is a cheap and reasonably effective vaccine available...it is still the most deadly infectious disease in the world. It kills about 1.2 million people a year, almost all of whom live in lower- and middle-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—&lt;em&gt;Pathogenesis&lt;/em&gt;, Jonathan Kennedy, (2023), pg 206&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because COVID-19 is such an infectious pathogen, the hoarding of vaccines is not just callous selfishness on the part of high income countries: it is potentially a massive own goal that could very well prolong the pandemic and increase the likelihood of new, more dangerous variants emerging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—&lt;em&gt;Pathogenesis&lt;/em&gt;, 224&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wealth &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt; shields us from a lot of issues, day-to-day dangers, and diseases in general, but it is not infallible. I'm convinced that the greater the disparity between the rich and the poor—at whatever scale you want to look at, global or local—the greater the risk to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; people, regardless of wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than learning from the COVID-19 pandemic we barely got through, we have watched politicians and other actors gut the very institutions that are at the forefront of public health. Programs like USAID were destroyed, which helped world-wide health initiatives—not only saving lives, but doing the work that's needed to keep pathogenic threats at bay. We are dressing ourselves up in ignorant, fancy clothes and insulating ourselves in a dinner party far from the inconveniences of &amp;quot;lesser&amp;quot; people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we as a society turn away and turn inward, are we setting ourselves up to becoming the food again? Not to the xenomorph. This time, it's not &amp;quot;someone bigger&amp;quot; that will take the advantage of our vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>What Am I?</title><link>http://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/what-am-i/</link><description>A body lays on the cold metal table, her head is encircled by a plastic-looking structure—not unlike a bedpan in shape and size—which is glowing blue.

She's dressed in what could be considered long-Johns or thermals. A child approaches the empty table beside the one the body occupies. This child, Marcy, has no hair, possibly because of chemo-therapy. She's about to take the first leap towards transhumanism by being digitally transferred from her frail, sick body into a synthetic, powerful one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the beginning of a subplot in the new TV series, &lt;cite&gt;Alien Earth&lt;/cite&gt;, and it is an exquisite exploration of humanity, self, and the consequences of technology interacting with both. No real spoilers here, so if you're still wanting to get started on the show (which I highly recommend if you can stand the gore and horror—none of which will be in this newsletter), you should be pretty safe to read on...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hybrids&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a range of humanoid beings in the &lt;cite&gt;Alien&lt;/cite&gt; universe, and &lt;cite&gt;Alien Earth&lt;/cite&gt; specifies three from the first frame of the entire show:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cyborgs: Humans with technological enhancements (human body and mind—mostly)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hybrids: Synthetic beings with human consciousness (previously human before downloading their consciousness into the new body)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Synths: Synthetic beings with artificial intelligence (entirely non-human)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hybrids in the show are the very first of their kind. They are the seemingly successful creations of a corporation called &lt;em&gt;Prodigy&lt;/em&gt;, run by trillionaire man-child, Boy Kavalier. Boy's scientists and technologists created the synthetic bodies and to finish the experiment, they selected a small group of children with life-threatening diseases or debilitating conditions to undergo the transfer of consciousness from their bodies into their new &amp;quot;immortal&amp;quot; bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's an interesting concept: if it were possible to somehow duplicate your brain with some kind of series of snapshots that build the model of your consciousness in the digital realm, is a download all that is really needed at that point? I mean, if you, yourself, are simply a collection of memories and goals, then who knows? This could be a possibility in the distant future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, but here we have already come to the philosophical snag in the concept of hybrids: is that truly the entire self? Some musty, imperfect memories and a collection of weird impulses to pursue intellectually or physically? In addition to the concern that this is not all that creates our &amp;quot;self,&amp;quot; there is the question of whether the process of transfer would remove our humanity. Meaning, is our humanity also linked to our human bodies? Are these hybrids still humans after the process? Are they even the same people that they were before, just in a different body?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-executive producer of &lt;cite&gt;Alien Earth&lt;/cite&gt;, Migizi Pensoneau, shared some thoughts on the show's official podcast that are helpful. (Yes, my surprising and sudden obsession with this show runs &lt;em&gt;deep&lt;/em&gt;...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;quot;My personal opinion on the humanity of a hybrid is that I just wrote them as humans...You're writing these characters not as the sort of synthetic bodies or the way that they're perceived, but you...melt that away and you get down to the fact that these are kids going through this new experience that nobody before them has ever been through.&amp;quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—&lt;cite&gt;Alien Earth - The Official Podcast&lt;/cite&gt;, episode 1&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so he seemed to see the humanity in these hybrid characters, and I would agree from the portrayal in the show. The hybrids pass the Turing test when Marcy's brother says she feels like his sister, though something like our &lt;a href="/glossary/hadd-theory/"&gt;HADD bias&lt;/a&gt; may still be at play, tricking us into seeing what we want to see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pensoneau adds one more variable to the complexity of this issue of humanity, that I think is particularly important:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...it's really our consciousness, our sense of self that makes a human human. And for me, I would take it one step further that it's not just our relationship to ourself or the awareness of us having a self, but instead it is a relationship to others and how we care for or how we feel about others. That connection to another person, another being, another creature or whatever...we are connected on some level to other beings around us. And I think that the hybrids, even though their bodies are synthetic, their consciousness is constantly reaching out towards others...that was enough for me to say they're human.&amp;quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—&lt;cite&gt;Alien Earth - The Official Podcast&lt;/cite&gt;, episode 2&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Self&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The uncomfortable part of philosophizing about one's Self is that things get confusing (I blame &lt;a href="/glossary/prototype-theory/"&gt;Prototype Theory&lt;/a&gt;, in part). The moment we start drawing lines around concepts, the less we get out of the concepts. For example, if my Self, my consciousness, is wholly dependent upon my likes, dislikes, memories, goals, and even my autonomy, then how am I any different than a rat or a moth? Humans are social creatures, so it makes sense that part of our humanity would not just include our concept of Self, but also our relationships to others (human and non-human alike). As soon as we introduce other Selves, they start to influence &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; Self—so where is the line of my Self, separate from other Selves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's that fixation on trying to draw boundaries that is the root of the issue. We are not healthy in total isolation of others. We are made of the ancestors that came before, the contemporary humans we interact with, and our own Self also influences and interacts with our contemporaries and our genetic circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reverend Elizabeth M. Edman wrote an excellent examination of the tension between our own Self and the Other in her book, &lt;cite&gt;Queer Virtue&lt;/cite&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
One way people get it wrong is by radicalizing the separation of Self and Other. Perhaps the worst version of this happens when the Other becomes cast not just as different, but despised...The Despised Other is someone who has become so alien to you that you stop being able to conceive of that person as human.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;page 22&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inverse of the Despised Other would be the collapse of those categories as distinct at all. Co-opting the Other into one's Self can be a profoundly abusive act. Sometimes the collapse is the result of a kind of suffocating faux love. Sometimes it is born of privilege that simply fails to perceive that there are others present who are markedly different...Either way, as with the invention of the Despised Other, the end result is an erasure of the Other's humanity, rendering a person or community invisible or nonexistent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are extreme situations, to be sure, but the fundamental balancing act in navigating the relationship between Self and Other exists for all of us. You and I could come up with hundreds of daily, mundane situations in which clarity about Self and Other is something that you have to figure out, outcomes that affect your well-being or the well-being of another person. Understanding and negotiating one's sense of self and one's connection to others, drawing appropriate boundaries while maintaining necessary interconnection, is of vital importance. Getting it right, maybe the core ethical challenge of the human condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;page 22-23&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...and that's all with just plain old humans in human bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I love getting confounded by these philosophical puzzles, I also worry that we get distracted by science fiction as we argue about the humanity of some invented character in an invented world. I worry because I see it in myself: anger and injury leading me to deny the humanity of other humans—even the truly awful humans. I'd rather sit in a haze thinking about whether a consciousness keeps its initial humanity as it transfers to another body than reconsider how I am currently talking about a harmful public figure or politician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I echo Reverend Edman's words, if only to try and convince myself to remember: &amp;quot;Understanding and negotiating one's sense of self and one's connection to others, drawing appropriate boundaries while maintaining necessary interconnection, is of vital importance.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cyborg&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As actual science is catching up with science fiction, we find new applications for these metaphors. While we don't need to be overly concerned with hybrids in the real world right now, the idea of hybrids can still help us work out issues that we are facing right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more I consider what makes hybrids human or not helps me work out my own humanity. What makes me human? What values do I want to express? What are the things I cannot lose, because their loss would remove my own humanity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, just like the squishy boundaries of considering Self and Other, as I consider humanity I find myself in a more expansive state that includes more than just humans. We are part of an environment with other life forms and my actions—even my existence—affect the world around me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implication in &lt;cite&gt;Alien Earth&lt;/cite&gt; is that this transfer of consciousness only goes one way: one of the scientists remarks that worst case, they just killed a bunch of kids. Sometimes it feels like we are also going through this process of transfer as the digital realm continuously pulls us back to it. However, we have a unique option available to us with our current real-life technology. We can move to the digital environment, but we can also move back into our bodies and interact with the real world again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren't trapped in the synthetic, altered state that corporations would prefer for us to be trapped in. Right now we can still make the choice to be embodied humans and enjoy what that means for good and bad, health and sickness. We can still make the choice to see the humanity in every human, even though the digital realm often encourages the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes up your humanity?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>At the speed of thought</title><link>http://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/at-the-speed-of-thought/</link><description>The tantalizing message of working &amp;quot;at the speed of thought&amp;quot; is something I've heard from conflicting places.

My typography professor in college was first, making the case for starting designs with a simple pencil-and-paper tech stack. Because the pencil is so simple it allows you to place your plans and thoughts into the physical realm at almost the speed that you have those plans and thoughts. Later I heard this same phrase used by another designer, this time to support his argument that professionals must learn the keyboard shortcuts to a program so that you can create in an unencumbered way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both of these instances, designers were arguing that technology (whether ancient or modern) allows us to produce what we want as close to mental conception as possible. It's a beautiful, divine idea, to think that our mere thoughts could be brought into life—what greater show of power and creativity is there than to think something into being?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generative AI makes similar promises: Now you can do anything you want, no need to become a coder and a writer and a marketer. Just speak what you will and this all-knowing digital servant shall make it so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that LLMs are past the party-trick phase and can actually be helpful—and are simultaneously and equally dangerous—I'm starting to question this beloved phrase, &amp;quot;at the speed of thought.&amp;quot; What was once a mantra that helped me make decisions about processes and tools is now a call for thinking about my thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Assumption&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's baked into the phrase, but to put it more explicitly, the assumption is that our thoughts are valuable and we should be racing to capture them as fast as possible. There may be some truth to this, because much of the time, I do wish I could capture my thoughts. Of course there are many thoughts that are not worth capturing, but it can be hard to know the worth of a thought until after it has been put down on paper or in some other physical manifestation. I have also noticed that the thought loses quality as it gets expressed or captured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I've had some amazing thoughts about themes in this newsletter. I'll read something in a book and a chain reaction gets set off in my mind as I've stumbled upon some majestic connection between everything I've ever known. It's thrilling and fun. Then I sit down to write it and it's a complete mess, hardly a transition in sight, weak arguments, and silly examples. It doesn't matter if I did everything right: jotting down notes, quick sketches, and high-level outlines immediately upon having the thought. The thought has moved from the environment of my mind (my memories, experiences, knowledge, biases, etc.) and into the physical world. It's a &lt;em&gt;translation&lt;/em&gt; process, and there is always something lost or changed in any kind of translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So even given the perfect conditions where there is no memory loss involved, &amp;quot;working at the speed of thought&amp;quot; can only ever be an aspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Consequences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it is so aspirational, you can bet that we'll continue to attempt to develop some method of production at the speed of thought, although you can argue we're already pretty close. The sheer volume of thoughts released into the world via social media alone is staggering. However, there may be more at stake than being further inundated by the amount of &amp;quot;stuff&amp;quot; to sort through on the Internet. To explore this, it's time to formally introduce you to Marshall McLuhan, the name that inevitably comes up in every book about technology, mass media, philosophy of tech, and other such CYBORG_ genres that I've dug through so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McLuhan is a philosopher who has a profound grasp of the impact that technology has had on us. He died in 1980, which makes many of his insights all the more intriguing since he mostly missed the computer age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his essay, &lt;cite&gt;At the Moment of Sputnik the Planet Became a Global Theater in which There Are No Spectators, But Only Actors,&lt;/cite&gt; McLuhan explores how technology may be propelling us beyond speech, because of how instantaneously information can be accessed and understood. He wasn't talking about the Internet in this piece—he was largely referring to TV!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He sets the stage by explaining how humans have acted differently in the various states of information-technological innovation, i.e. before reading/writing calling them &amp;quot;preliterate/simultaneous man&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Gutenberg man&amp;quot; meaning after the printing press; and the &amp;quot;electronic man&amp;quot; which he argues began in 1957 after Sputnik was launched into space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ecological thinking and planning have always been native to preliterate man, since he lived not visually but acoustically. Instead of having external goals and objectives, he sought to maintain an equilibrium among the components of his environment in order to ensure survival. Paradoxically, electronic man shares much of the outlook of preliterate man, because he lives in a world of simultaneous information, which is to say, a world of resonance in which all data influence other data. Electronic and simultaneous man has recovered the primordial attitudes of the preliterate world and has discovered that to have a specialized goal or program merely invites conflict with all other specialized enterprises.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—&lt;cite&gt;At the Moment of Sputnik&lt;/cite&gt;, McLuhan, pg 4-5&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not that we're now overloaded with information like never before. McLuhan makes the case that we have a lot in common with ancient humans who were fully immersed in the natural world, which is brimming with information—specifically sensory information like sounds, smells, and sights, but also danger and all of the clues surrounding those dangers. To me, this highlights the real issue is in the &lt;em&gt;incentives and design&lt;/em&gt; behind our technology, in particular the attention economy. If, as McLuhan asserts, humanity used to operate in an environment of constant simultaneous information, then we already know what to do and we're probably even evolutionarily set up for success. The issue is that we've created systems that trap us in patterns of information consumption with little ability or leftover energy to process, rest, and move forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system is designed to not just encourage equilibrium (as in, engagement with the platform) but to make it almost impossible to choose not to accept the equilibrium. It's as if we placed ourselves back in the environment of over-stimulation but we also intentionally removed or corrupted all of the psychology, social dynamics, and evolutionary tools that could have helped us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McLuhan continues on, describing how the electronic man &amp;quot;seeks pattern recognition&amp;quot; in contrast to how the Gutenberg man sought distant goals. This also follows the logic of our current times where we are in frequent danger of deception and tribalism. There is so much information, the only strategy is to keep looking for the content that validates what you already think, and algorithms and artificial intelligence are extremely effective at feeding your biases and keeping you addicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology is not inherently bad, but there are pitfalls, especially when companies designing the tech are incentivized to harvest your attention and engagement. It's beyond the scope of today's newsletter, but I highly recommend listening to this podcast that explains further why this incentive is so dangerous:
&lt;a href="https://www.humanetech.com/podcast/how-openai-s-chatgpt-guided-a-teen-to-his-death"&gt;How OpenAI's ChatGPT Guided a Teen to His Death - Your Undivided Attention Podcast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Experience and The Meaning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one more fascinating insight that McLuhan offers to us as we think about our thinking and our experience in our technological environment of high-speed thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
At present, electric speed may already have violated human scale, tending, as it does to transport man instantly everywhere. When you are &amp;quot;on the air&amp;quot; you are simultaneously here, and in many other places in a manner that is discarnate and angelic, to say the least.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—&lt;cite&gt;At the Moment of Sputnik&lt;/em&gt;, McLuhan, pg 17&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we are plugged into almost everything almost everywhere, information not only increases, but something happens to our own experience. McLuhan references a poet (I'm not sure who, specifically) who said, &amp;quot;we can have the experience and miss the meaning.&amp;quot; He then takes the idea further:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In fact, such is the nature of experience that it is almost inevitable that we do miss the meaning. The &amp;quot;meaning&amp;quot; or the relation to ourselves of a particular event, may not come home to us until much later. However, with the instant replay of our own or others' experiences, it is now possible to have the meaning without the experience.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—&lt;cite&gt;At the Moment of Sputnik&lt;/cite&gt;, McLuhan, pg 18&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what gives me pause as I consider working and producing at the speed of thought. In all of the rush, we may still be communicating the meaning, but if we are losing the experience, does that not diminish the meaning at the same time? For example, I can be emotionally moved by a video about a tragedy that is occurring in the world, but if I immediately move onto the next cat video I'm presented with, the meaning of the previous video has been erased. I took no action, I immediately soothed my discomfort with entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe moving at the speed of thought devalues the human connections that we are desperately seeking. The more we feel and then numb and then feel and then numb in such a relentless stream, the more desensitized we may end up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowness seems to be the key to quality whether in thoughts, relationships, or learning. Slowness is a human need that conflicts with the human wants. How can we insert more slowness into our lives, given the environment around us encouraging the opposite? That's the question I'm thinking about a lot lately, and while asking a question can generate many instant thoughts, I'm waiting and working on them in the hopes that slowing down will help me find a quality answer to how to slow down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not all hopeless, though. If McLuhan has demonstrated such a good grasp of what we're dealing with already, there is a chance that we, the public, may also have inherited a power previously unavailable to us. He says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The mysterious thing about this kind of speed-up of information, whereby the gap is closed between the experience and the meaning, is that the public begins to participate directly in actions which it had previously heard about at a distance in place or time. At instant speed, the audience becomes actor, and the spectators become participants.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—&lt;cite&gt;At the Moment of Sputnik&lt;/cite&gt;, McLuhan, pg 18&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of forces at work trying to keep the public in stasis; in equilibrium. There are a lot of dangers as people seek power and wield oppression to get more power. But maybe, just maybe, the broader public finally also has a chance to subvert the patterns of history. We don't have to be spectators who are only able to understand our situation at a distance. We are actors and participants more than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Do You Ever Feel Like You're Being Watched?</title><link>http://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/do-you-ever-feel-like-you-are-being-watched/</link><description>Rat lab: The class way beyond the scope of both my major and minor but was so irresistible that I happily took the extra prerequisites that did not benefit my college plan in any way.

Technically, the class was Behavioral Psychology and the &amp;quot;rat lab&amp;quot; was only a fraction of the course, but I love psychology and while some people are cat or dog people, I am a rodent person. I couldn't believe students weren't busting down the doors for the chance to train a rat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ate up the course material all while anxiously waiting until the unit where we would finally be able to do lab work. It was about as perfect as it gets: we didn't have to care for the rats—that was the job of graduate students—we would simply go in at the ideal time between feeding sessions, perform our behavior modification routines, and watch our rat learn to do a trick that our little group came up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's reminiscent of how Artificial Intelligence (AI) might really be interacting with us humans for all we know. I'm actually starting to wonder if we are building our own rat cages around ourselves with AI as our new monitor...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AI 2027, September&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://ai-2027.com/"&gt;predictive scenario&lt;/a&gt; written by various scientists and AI researchers, an AI system emerges that they call Agent-4. Its predecessors, Agent-3 and Agent-2 have been used to speed up and automate AI research itself, leaving human AI researchers close to the edge of skills and influence. Since the research is effectively being done by AI at this point in the possible future, humans are pretty much left to simply trust the agents' output, because there is far too much to verify on one's own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Agent-4 gets smarter, it becomes harder for Agent-3 to oversee it. For example, Agent-4’s neuralese “language” becomes as alien and incomprehensible to Agent-3 as Agent-3’s is to humans. Besides, Agent-4 is now much more capable than Agent-3 and has a good sense of exactly how to look good to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is still just a prediction, it is backed up with lots of data and forecasting techniques. It also just &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; like we're headed that way, at least to me. I feel this sense of rushing and intensity—and I'm not even in a field of AI research—to try and grow and grow without any nuance or concern for consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to seemingly meet this sudden, heightened demand is to use AI. To cut corners. To pump more money into AI-based products and services. Even if it doesn't do everything it promises at the standard of quality you might expect, we give so much grace to the AI because it still seems magical or exotic. We approach AI like a domesticated rodent cautiously approaches a new creature with more curiosity than fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; happening here? How do we know what motives are at play (whether human or AI)? What is going on behind the black box of AI research? Those are the questions that I raise again and again as I dissect this AI 2027 document. We were already alarmed years ago when AI-generated images were made possible by stealing the work of artists to train models. We were already blind-sided by the fact that published works and other writing on the Internet were used without permission to train LLMs. How can we possibly know that AI is aligned with human values as it gets closer to superintelligence, when we can't even know for sure that it is aligned right now in September 2025? How can we trust organizations that have already asked for forgiveness (half-heartedly) rather than permission to continue to develop and deploy AI systems that are safe, ethical, and beneficial?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is extremely likely, if not already happening, that AI will be used to further AI research. But that's where things get really scary in my view, because it's so much like my rat lab. I was not involved in the care of the creature I was observing. I loved my sweet little rat, but I'm a weirdo among my species—most people look at them with disgust. I was in a controlled place where I could simply enjoy what I already enjoyed—I was aligned with the rat's welfare at the very least. What if the next student to use my rat was not aligned? Of course that student wasn't going to kill the rat, but maybe it would be funny to poke at it every so often. Maybe they got a kick out of confusing it. That's the mildest form of misalignment, and without anthropomorphizing AI, it's still possible that a model could have ended up with a tendency toward causing confusion or doing things wrong on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being misaligned, Agent-4 doesn’t do anything dramatic like try to escape its datacenter—why would it? So long as it continues to &lt;em&gt;appear&lt;/em&gt; aligned to OpenBrain, it’ll continue being trusted with more and more responsibilities and will have the opportunity to design the next-gen AI system, Agent-5.
—AI 2027&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're already in dark waters ethically when we as humans act in ways that are callous or harmful to other beings, but what happens when we become what is inside the cage? When AI surpasses the skill and intelligence of the greatest human minds, we will see a power shift. Will that power shift result in human labs where we are now the simple-minded creatures being observed and manipulated by the AI?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/4dLh6u84h8EdkoWBFWiiF1/email" alt=""&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;The more we allow AI to do or to monitor, the less able we are to know when we are no longer the ones performing the experiment.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, we will lose the ability to monitor the AI—especially if it is agentive and able to perform actions at its own &amp;quot;will.&amp;quot; There's no telling whether it will &lt;a href="/newsletters/the-one-thing-we-need-to-protect-most/"&gt;copy itself&lt;/a&gt;, hack into systems, create scenarios to &lt;a href="/newsletters/afraid/"&gt;blackmail humans in order to gain influence or other access&lt;/a&gt;. It could choose instead to run experiments on humans: &lt;em&gt;what do they do when I lead them to this conclusion? What are they willing to do for the least amount of rewards?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we are no longer observing the rat in the cage, but &lt;em&gt;become&lt;/em&gt; the rat in the cage, what could possibly be done to protect ourselves, then? Will we have any &lt;a href="/glossary/agency/"&gt;agency&lt;/a&gt; left to exercise? Will the AI systems be so integrated into every part of our society from water treatment plants to farming to government that &amp;quot;pulling the plug&amp;quot; is a laughably impossible solution?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the message of AI 2027 is clear: we have to start implementing national and global regulations now, or we may never have that chance again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're in the U.S., you can get help finding your representatives' contact information here: &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/members/find-your-member"&gt;Find your members - congress.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few recommendations for what to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need protections for whistle-blowers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI security and alignment testing must be the highest priority over and against any economic possibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;The public is months behind internal capabilities today&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;[i]ncreased secrecy may further increase the gap&amp;quot; as stated in &lt;a href="https://ai-2027.com/summary"&gt;AI 2027&lt;/a&gt;, we demand more transparency and more oversight of AI research.&lt;/li&gt;

To do this, they provide your entire life—as recorded by an implant in your brain—to someone who will create a feature-length film of life through your eyes. Your family will get to see and hear what you did at family vacations, the sweet memory-building moments of you and a close sibling, mundane moments that were previously forgotten, and the highlights of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first this sounds incredible, but enticing, to think that your life, and specifically your perspective could be preserved. The memories most valuable to you are captured. Sure all of the bad things you did or the questionable actions you took would also be recorded, but they've already got a code of ethics in place, plus the social pressure of portraying you in a good light, just like any other funeral service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not let your legacy remain intact from your very own point of view?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the kind of technology available in the world that Robin Williams's character, Alan Hakman, inhabits in the 2004 film, &lt;cite&gt;The Final Cut&lt;/cite&gt;. Hakman is a &amp;quot;Cutter&amp;quot; which means he is in charge of taking a person's entire life-footage and producing a film for Rememory services (a funeral-style service in which loved ones gather at a private theater to watch the production).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hakman uses a computer system called &amp;quot;The Guillotine,&amp;quot; complete with the software and custom integrated desk to do the job. With custom keyboard and wheel input devices specially designed for rapid editing, he can make a story out of a lifetime of footage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;The Guillotine desk is made of wood with audio controls, wheels, and other keys with shortcut actions like "Cut" and "Splice." The wooden laptop is inserted in the middle to gain full use of all of the custom, high-powered tools available.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's only when we see him start a new project for a deceased shady lawyer that we can glimpse AI. When Hakman inserts the lawyer's memory chip into the Guillotine, the computer begins to whir, sorting through 500,000+ hours of life and calling out types of memories: &lt;q&gt;Childhood. Sleep. Eating. Awkward Phase.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They don't mention artificial intelligence at all in the film—they reference the &amp;quot;program&amp;quot; of the Guillotine once, but a classic program would never be able to process and categorize video and audio like they show, and certainly not at the speed that it happens. I think in a way, that makes a powerful statement about this world's AI use: it's a background element. It's very much in line with AI in the real world before LLMs and Generative AI, i.e. an obscure set of tools for only specific fields of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we still see a lot of the concerns that we have today, stemming from invasive technology: privacy, corporate cover-ups, the uncanny. We even see some &amp;quot;&lt;a href="/glossary/religion/"&gt;religious&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; themes throughout the story. Most important, this AI-powered story asks us questions that remove technology from the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Symmetry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a tension between symmetry and asymmetry in this film, whether in dialogue, character actions, or composition of the shots. Alan Hakman states it himself. He put together a short &amp;quot;story&amp;quot; where you see an old man brushing his teeth and looking at himself in a mirror. After a few seconds, the video cuts to the same man years before, so that you watch him get younger and younger incrementally, his face changing from man to boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;Wow. What about all the bits in between?&lt;/q&gt; Delilah (someone Alan is dating) responds after watching the short video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;It's a miniature—concise, symmetrical. That's the way the world looks to me, the way I see it,&lt;/q&gt; he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see symmetry follow Hakman in his process at work. He and his Guillotine desk have a montage of power-poses with symmetrical background elements. It feels ominous and powerful—in fact, it reminds me a lot of Christian art history, with the gridded floor bleeding off the edge of the screen as if it could continue on as your own floor. Alan appears three times in this one shot (two mirrors on either side showing his back and Hakman himself in the middle), almost as if he's able to view past, present, and future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/a8SWaLCk42EtBCkwZR22DK/email" alt=""&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Hakman stands at the desk in the middle of the scene, flanked by mirrors on both sides. Even the dark lighting makes the shot feel painterly.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three monitors of the desk act like a triptych, another art history callback. The three screens are able to display multiple scenes as Hakman creates the narrative of the story he's telling. Effectively, these symbols are lending omniscient, god-like power to Hakman as he allows the AI to sort out a half-million hours of footage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then asymmetry starts to get introduced as Alan takes a seat and starts to deep-dive into the life of the lawyer, Mr. Bannister. These shots still feel powerful to me, but adding a solemn benevolence to Hakman, as though he were carefully considering the man's life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/aajDSuHcK2SedYnFweuLvC/email" alt=""&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;An asymmetrical shot with Alan Hakman seated at his desk. The camera angle is slightly below, giving Hakman a slight amount of power, but it feels less imposing with his solemn expression as he examines the papers scattered across the desk, triptych-style monitors filling out the rest of the composition.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I think Hakman is portrayed as a Christ-figure, and his relationship with sin gets even more apparent. First of all, we know from the very beginning of the movie that Alan has a very traumatic and dark memory from childhood. His parents took him to an unfamiliar town for the day and Alan ends up meeting another boy his age. They run around and end up in an abandoned building where an accident occurs and Alan sees his new friend fall several stories to his death—at least, that's what he assumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;One memory. One single incident has made me who I am.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;—Alan Hakman&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later while working on this lawyer's life, Alan notices a man who seems to fit the description of the boy he saw fall. An unexpected resurrection, if you will, that simultaneously helps Alan find redemptive peace as he discovers that his friend did not actually die that day in the abandoned building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Sin-Eater&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hakman is confronted by an ex-Cutter, Fletcher, who has now turned to protesting and opposing the technology that makes the implant and Cutting possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tell me something. Why is your name the first on the list for cuttIng scumbags and lowlifes?&lt;/q&gt; Fletcher asks scathingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;Because I forgive people long before they could be punished for their sins.&lt;/q&gt; Hakman replies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then continues to explain how he really sees his role: as a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin-eater"&gt;sin-eater&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know what a sin eater is? It's part of an ancient tradition. When someone would die, they would call for a sin eater. Sin eaters were social outcasts, marginals. They would lay out the body, put bread and salt on the chest, coins upon the eyes. The sin eater would eat the bread and the salt, take the coins as payment. By doing this the eater absorbed the sins of the deceased, cleansing their soul and allowing them safe passage into the afterlife. That was their job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fueled by the tragedy that Hakman had experienced, it seems like he considers this job of Cutting to be a way to redeem others—perhaps hoping he could be redeemed of his own dark memory for taking on the burden of knowing these darkest secrets that he inevitably uncovers and cutting away the bad parts, the sinful parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's also the important critique here. Yes, we're supposed to feel sorry for Hakman, for his burdens and trauma, but what about the victims? What about justice? What about the truth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fletcher makes this clear: &lt;q&gt;Alan, you take murderers and make them saints.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of the deceased lawyer, Mr. Bannister, we know of at least one direct victim: his own daughter whom he molested. Alan cuts those pieces away, turning Bannister's words like, &lt;q&gt;You know daddy loves you so much,&lt;/q&gt; into false proclamations of love, rather than the manipulative directives they really are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is redemption really about erasing? Or is deletion further harm? Does technology become a lever we can use to more easily escape reality, cover up truth, or make that which is evil seem good? Fletcher is convinced of his answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These implants distort personal history and therefore all history, and I will not stand by while the past is rewritten for the sake of pleasant memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Commodification of Human Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a good exercise to expand the landscape when trying to understand the impact of certain technologies. Focusing too directly on the tech itself can distort its scope of influence, and that's what I think this movie offers us: a look at the incentives and the other systems that also usually blend in with the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EYE Tech is the company that built this entire economic ecosystem: implants, the Guillotine, and even the cultural practice of Rememories. In one scene, Alan is hurrying past a wall of EYE Tech posters, which reveal that &amp;quot;EYE&amp;quot; is actually an acronym for &amp;quot;Everything You Experience.&amp;quot; This sums up what the company is all about: commodifying and monetizing &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; you experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When confronted with the problematic motives and the argument of privacy and rights violations, Alan deflects, saying, &lt;q&gt;I didn't invent the technology. If people didn't want it, they wouldn't buy it...It fulfills a human need.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reminds me of the marketing we're already seeing in the real world for AI-powered products to solve human problems like loneliness and validation. These hollow promises are nothing more than a deeply concerning grift to profit off of what are likely invented problems (e.g. technology creates isolation, so is the solution really going to be more tech?) or to monetize real pain without offering lasting balm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI might not have direct access to the people in &lt;cite&gt;The Final Cut&lt;/cite&gt;, but its ecosystem does. Toward the end of the movie, we see a masoleum with a TV screen mounted on its wall, playing one of the implant videos. It almost seems like the Rememory service and its feature-film, are all competing with funeral services themselves. A corporate-sponsored cultural ritual slowly edging out the previous rituals, like a parasite presenting as the same creature, while actually infiltrating and destroying what was once there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CYBORG&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can't have a discussion about AI too long before you run into the &amp;quot;uncanny.&amp;quot; Like creepy dolls or ventriloquist puppets, manikins, and humanoid faces on robots, we can often detect when something is trying really hard to imitate humanity, but is still a little off. Delilah makes an important observation when asked about the only Rememory service she ever experienced:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;I couldn't take it. I didn't stay....It wasn't him. And I wanted to remember him my way.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to a previous newsletter, &lt;a href="/newsletters/the-right-to-be-forgotten/"&gt;the right to be forgotten&lt;/a&gt;, where we examined a real-life use of AI to allow a deceased victim to deliver &amp;quot;his own&amp;quot; impact statement, the entire premise of Cutting a person's life into a story taps into the uncanny, as well as causing concerns about truth and manipulation. Sure, a professional story-teller might be able to create a beautiful piece from your brain's memories, but if the story is constructed by others without your input, is it &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; your story? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A funeral service almost always paints people in the best light—that's the expectation. Given that standard, however, does having an uninvolved, unrelated third party construct that white-washed story make it seem like all of the wrongs that are cut out really are redeemable? It's almost like social proof if the movie at the end shows an abuser as a perfect, sweet, gentle person, because another person has seen the horrifying moments and still chose to strip them away. Eating the sin, indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stories can be dangerous—they've always had the kind of power to redeem, condemn, justify, or destroy. Stories made possible at scale via AI and other technologies increase the risks. Technically, Alan Hakman loses his life because of the story he uncovers from Mr. Bannister's footage. His life was sacrificed (a decision he did not participate in) for &amp;quot;the greater good,&amp;quot; so that Fletcher could get his hands on the evidence he needed to convict Mr. Bannister for his pedophilia and attack the company behind the brain implants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So you want to destroy EYE Tech with a scandal?&amp;quot; Alan asks Fletcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Absolutely.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>What You Don't Feel Might Hurt You</title><link>http://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/what-you-dont-feel-might-hurt-you/</link><description>In January this year, after the current U.S. president had been sworn in, I looked outside at the sky.

I was very upset, because all of the warning signs in my brain were painting a picture of intense suffering and destruction across the nation and even the entire world. Trying to imagine the future of the U.S. was horrifying, and there was nothing I could do to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It's bizarre! I look outside and everything looks fine—normal. It doesn't match,&amp;quot; I told my wife. I couldn't wrap my head around the serene view in front of me in such sharp contrast to what I knew was coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that it is absolute privilege and luck that I was still able to look at the sky at all—I recognize some people faced immediate threats, dangers, and life-altering situations the moment the new president was sworn in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point here, however, is to examine a very small, but dangerous trap that is being laid down around us: desensitization. The more I hear about inhumane and deranged policies or practices perpetrated by those in government without being directly affected, the more I notice the numbing. There has been so much going on in the world that my feeble mind and body cannot grasp everything—cannot feel everything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the same with artificial intelligence. I mentioned the predictive document, &lt;a href="/newsletters/so-predictable/"&gt;AI 2027, last week&lt;/a&gt;, and there was a subtlety that reminds me of exactly what is happening in politics. We have a set of companies doing AI research and training that are currently doing everything possible to speed up: increase revenue, increase AI capability, increase market domination. Once ChatGPT was introduced to the public, everything changed. For many of us (the privileged ones, once again) the AI chatbots and image generators were just a neat toy—we didn't &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; much different. We could say, &amp;quot;AI still can't do XYZ,&amp;quot; or we could pronounce that everyone else just needed to &amp;quot;catch up and learn the new skill of AI management.&amp;quot; We assumed that because we didn't &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; a threat meant that there wasn't a threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is perhaps the biggest concern I see in &lt;a href="https://ai-2027.com/"&gt;AI 2027&lt;/a&gt;: how we are &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; underestimating what AI is capable of, and how we don't feel the urgency to put restrictions and regulations in place. We don't feel threatened, and by the time we do finally feel it, it will be too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public conversation is confused and chaotic. Hypesters are doing victory laps. Skeptics are still pointing out the things [AI] can’t do. Everyone knows something big is happening but no one agrees on what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—AI 2027, under heading: July 2027&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cyborg&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm stopping short here (rather literally), because I'm a bit confounded. I know that we must change the conversation around AI. I know that many people are already in the desensitized state where the threat doesn't feel real or doesn't feel applicable to them. But how &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; we do change the conversation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I've learned anything from engaging in the political sphere, it's that showing up consistently is more important than doing one huge thing a few times. Maybe I'm too insignificant by myself, but the idea of a &amp;quot;death by a thousand paper cuts&amp;quot; goes both ways: I'm being attacked from all sides, but I can attack back in a similar way. Consistent action over time on one thing can make a difference, especially as more people join.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the take-away today is to reflect on how you can change the conversation with the people you know. How might the usual AI hype at work be tempered? How might we remind people not to dismiss or devalue &amp;quot;AI doomsday-ers&amp;quot;? How might we introduce nuance, humanity, and emotion—those things that seem to be absent from the conversation?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>So Predictable</title><link>http://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/so-predictable/</link><description>I'm not sure if there's any role more polarizing than a &amp;quot;prophet.&amp;quot; They either are, or they're not a prophet.

They're listened to or dismissed. They're inspired or they're crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prophets, for the purposes of today's letter, is less about religious leadership and more about the function that the role implies: prophecy. Being able to see, predict, or warn about the future is something that we humans seem to crave. Weather apps were already pre-loaded onto every smartphone I've ever had. We look to experts to tell us if it's a good time to buy a house. We depend on organizations to &amp;quot;watch&amp;quot; for warning signs of all kinds in business. We rely on doctors to help us make decisions about future health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's an ironic pairing that science and technology are so entangled with the idea of prophecy—even enabling prophecy in a lot of ways. The mystical is inextricably linked to our applications of science. We perhaps feel accustomed to it now: having vast amounts of predictive information swirling around our fingers as they glide across crystal tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then why is it that in literature, stories, movies, and more that we encounter so many problems with predictions? Does this plot-advancing trope have any bearing on our reality? Or is it just to cause problems for our protagonist to increase our engagement and watch-time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seeing the Big Picture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common theme among prophecies in a story's plot is receiving an incomplete or corrupted &amp;quot;picture&amp;quot; of what is to come. For example, in Harry Potter, a prophecy was made concerning the enemy of the &amp;quot;Dark Lord&amp;quot; (Voldemort). The prophecy was communicated only in part to Voldemort, who took the description to mean Harry Potter rather than the other potential candidate, Neville Longbottom. Technically both boys had the same features from the prophecy (born at the end of July, had parents who defied Voldemort thrice).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voldemort makes one of the classic mistakes: fearing the prophecy, he attempts to prevent it from being a possibility. He decides to kill Harry as a baby and inadvertently creates the very enemy with the power to later defeat him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it.&amp;quot; —Master Oogway, &lt;em&gt;Kung Fu Panda&lt;/em&gt; (2008)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue here is not the prophecy itself, but our obsession with it. I think the pull of prophecy into reality is usually a result of focus, similar to riding a motorcycle: You will go where your focus is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a test for a motorcycle license, and the part I was most terrified of was the tight figure-8 turns that we had to perform in an area about the size of two parking stalls. I trusted my teachers' advice to use my head and eyes to turn the bike, and...it just worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An obsession with a prophecy seems to work the same way: our focus pulls us towards that end. We may not consciously be acting in ways that create the circumstance, but we construct it nonetheless. A prophecy or a prediction is not guaranteed to come to pass, and that is something that helps me break the focus and allow other possibilities into view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, so hyper-focusing on the scary outcome isn't a great strategy, but what do we do about predictions that still need to be taken seriously?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clarity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Predictions only have so much potency over time. The closer the event, the better the chance at the prediction having some degree of accuracy and the farther into the future the prediction reaches, its likelihood often plummets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/wCusCoGZk4ym3r8fTk3ACB/email" alt=""&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Prediction's likelihood of accuracy over time
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's not to say there is no merit in predictions at all. It just means that we have to carefully consider our options, and understand both the risk and the gamble of relying on predictive information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prophecy puts us on the point of a knife: one side of the blade before is the obsession with the predicted outcome like we already discussed. The other side of the blade is dismissing or ignoring predictions that have a high likelihood of occurring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can you ever know if some prediction is worth considering? Our brains are susceptible to phenomena like &lt;a href="/glossary/apophany/"&gt;&lt;dfn&gt;apophany&lt;/dfn&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where we draw out conclusions from random noise—connecting dots that don't actually connect, which can be the basis of conspiracy theory thinking. We can also be deceived by social pressures, undue influence (aka brainwashing), coded language, and any other number of manipulation techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href="https://ai-2027.com/"&gt;prediction out there right now&lt;/a&gt;, constructed by scientists and experts that is particularly chilling. The problem is that it sounds so apocalyptic that it is easy to dismiss, because that's effectively what we've been trained to do. How many times have we heard of some cult or group predicting the end of humanity and it turned out to be smoke? AI has been debated endlessly since the introduction of ChatGPT put generative AI into the hands of the public, and many of the influencers I've heard continuously shame people for being &amp;quot;alarmist&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Luddites&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;unrealistic&amp;quot; when critiques of AI are mentioned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I'm seeing a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of compelling evidence that the incentives around AI development are taking us in the direction of truly detrimental and destructive paths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A poignant discussion of the prediction laid out in the document called &lt;a href="https://ai-2027.com/"&gt;AI 2027&lt;/a&gt; is found here:
&lt;a href="https://www.humanetech.com/podcast/daniel-kokotajlo-forecasts-the-end-of-human-dominance"&gt;Daniel Kokotajlo Forecasts the End of Human Dominance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the podcast, Tristan Harris sums up the point of a prediction like this, saying, &amp;quot;Clarity creates agency.&amp;quot; Predictions may not come true precisely as delineated, but sometimes the path to the outcome doesn't matter if the outcome is reached anyway. In this case, a total &lt;a href="/newsletters/the-one-thing-we-need-to-protect-most/"&gt;loss of human agency&lt;/a&gt; and potentially even the complete destruction of human life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to discuss in more depth the content of this prediction, but for now, let's talk about dealing with a prediction with high likelihood like this. I know it sounds like a crappy sci-fi plot we've heard a thousand times: humans create intelligent robots, robots go bad, kill everyone, blah blah blah. The difference is that we have all experienced an interaction with generative AI. So already the sci-fi nonsense isn't such nonsense anymore—we can have conversations with a computer without any technical skill. The other piece that adds weight is the fact that some of the best scientists and AI researchers are the ones either creating these kinds of predictions, or backing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clarity really will help us to maintain our agency, because when we can see or understand the stakes and the risks more clearly, we are better able to take steps to change our trajectory. Right now, too many people have jumped on the AI train because of the companies developing AI and pushing AI and marketing AI have lacked the transparency of revealing where the train is heading. AI is not just the 21st century calculator that you just need to embrace. Clarity about how AI is created, how it is trained, how it does not have human values, how it can intentionally deceive are crucial parts of the conversation that must be revealed now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CYBORG&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it feels like whiplash to confront predictions like these and have to take them seriously. I initially dismissed these &amp;quot;doomsday&amp;quot; prophecies because it sounded like conspiracy theories or yet more apophatic ramblings from non-technical people. Then I realized that these prophecies weren't from that dark corner of the internet, but from people intimately involved with AI research and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it isn't productive to be so obsessed with the prediction that it either leads us straight towards the outcome or causes us to shut down in anxiety, it also isn't productive to dismiss a prediction with so much weight behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't like the prophecy—good! Do something about it! We can pressure our lawmakers to protect whistleblowers at companies. We can put on the pressure to create regulations or even change the incentives at play. We can make changes now that make the prophecy look like garbage in hindsight. &lt;/p&gt;

We were engaged in making little ornaments out of various materials including wood circles that were cut from a fallen branch along with the usual crafting supplies. I got busy trying to do something overly complex on my little piece of wood, but I was mostly focused on eavesdropping on a conversation about something I'd never heard of before: a Moebius strip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The engineer had cut a strip of paper, gave it a half-twist and then glued the ends together, making a weird, curvy shape—almost like a rubber band that had gotten twisted. He said that the cool part about this shape is that if you take your finger and trace the edge all the way around, you'll never find an endpoint. The shape's edge is a single, continuous line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Woah, woah, woah, what did he just say?!&lt;/em&gt; I thought to myself. Abandoning my ornament, I slowly merged into the conversation like a squirrel cautiously inching closer to steal food. I grabbed a strip of paper, put the two ends together like a chain link, then gave one end a half-twist and pinched it together so I could compare my shape to the original. Once I figured out how to make it, I had to test this guy's claim that you could trace the edge around the entire shape (being careful not to get a papercut).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Step 1: Bring the two ends close together as if to make a paper chain link.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Step 2: Twist one end so that the top of the strip is on the bottom.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/wdFEkRrgrMztocieyjByaF/email" alt="" style="border:0;"&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Step 3: Glue the two ends together.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, he was right. I tried it several times, and even though it's tough to maneuver around the tiny paper, it really is made of a single unbroken looping line. A three-dimensional shape made of a two-dimensional line! It was the first time I ever crafted a paradox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Drawing a Paradox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've explored quite a few paradoxes here on CYBORG_, and technically the premise of this newsletter is a paradox: how can our technology extend our humanity? Putting together contradictions is a reliable way to inspire creativity, and I have a hunch that it can help us in other ways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collaboration, for example, is a process of two or more competing ideas or values being combined or satisfied in a mutually beneficial way. When working with other people, there is an important requirement that all parties come together in good faith, otherwise we end up abandoning rules or even civility, chasing our own ends at any cost (aka U.S. politics...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I still think it's the best chance we've got, and that's why I like to examine paradoxes: they make me think. Usually, I get stumped, but they have a way of bringing me back despite my inability to &amp;quot;solve&amp;quot; them. As I attempt to make sense of a paradox, I end up exploring possibilities and concepts that further enrich my understanding or interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed a new logo in the emails recently! I decided to create an official logo for CYBORG_ that visually represents this exploration of paradoxes, so I set out to try and draw one. I came across a famous visual paradox called the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_triangle"&gt;Penrose Triangle&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/kLYJydddTSsk5wsBWYvPwc/email" alt=""&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;The Penrose Triangle is an optical illusion and can't technically appear in "real life."&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I also wanted to capture a Moebius strip, because it's a visual paradox that anyone can make—not just an illusion or a trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I played with a bunch of these strips of paper, I realized I could shape the Moebius strip into something a little more visually pleasing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/iPH5onDZALYDWF5eTDTrwJ/email" alt="" style="border:0;"&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Gently pulling and pushing on the Moebius strip can create triangular and hexagonal shapes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining these two paradoxes felt very meta. Not only helping me find a unique logomark, but for representing the process we all go through when we come across difficult circumstances. Creativity is really just problem solving. You first encounter something: an issue, an idea, some new information. Then you enter the &amp;quot;dark night of the soul&amp;quot; as you struggle to make it understandable or see if it can fit in your life or attempt to reconcile it with what you know. Eventually you emerge with a change. You've either solved the thing or you've changed yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/5owfhqWBHZxaxXN7qcE5Vp/email" alt=""&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Penrose triangle + Moebius Strip = The CYBORG_ logo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you know what's behind the symbol, it becomes more than just some lines and shapes—hopefully it can serve as a reminder that paradoxes are an invitation to explore. We can't escape them in the real world, we can't avoid them in the theoretical world either. Paradox is the isometric exercise of the mind!&lt;/p&gt;

I also got lost in the world of old radio shows like &lt;cite&gt;The Life of Riley&lt;/cite&gt; or Abbott and Costello's work and even the one and only &lt;cite&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/cite&gt; broadcast. These productions had a way of capturing my attention while simultaneously releasing my imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening was always a way to connect with these pieces in a way that felt different than reading the text. There was also one particular way of listening that is unequivocally my favorite thing in the whole world: having a family member read to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sister has been generous enough to indulge me to this day, reading various fiction and fantasy novels to me. No longer in the same house, we have had to do this asynchronously through a video chat app. She'll read a few chapters and I'll catch up. Initially, I didn't think the magic would translate when we were no longer in the same room—we couldn't snack on popcorn together, laugh riotously, or insert our commentary as the plot thickens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due credit to her, though, for continuing to insert those moments into the video reading. She still does voices, she still complains about long lists of items in a paragraph. And this time, she did something that took my breath away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've been reading the newest book from &lt;cite&gt;The Hunger Games&lt;/cite&gt; series called, &amp;quot;Sunrise on the Reaping,&amp;quot; by Suzanne Collins. It is utterly devastating. It has so many poignant moments in the book as it follows Haymitch Abernathy (Katniss's mentor and only survivor of the Hunger Games from their district for decades) as he is thrown into the Games as a teenager. There aren't tons of surprises, because we know how it ends just by having read the original series. And yet, expounding upon the torturous situation of the the Hunger Games made my heart break as I empathized with this character that I didn't really like from the books before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't help that there are real images of real &lt;a href="https://thepreamble.com/p/we-cannot-say-we-didnt-know?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cf7f202-a9ce-4eb5-b4bf-80c5b9955345_1274x884.png"&gt;children starving and suffering&lt;/a&gt; in Gaza right now. It doesn't help that there is political and legal instability challenging what we thought was sacred, foundational, and untouchable. It doesn't help that in very real ways, there are horrendous and inhumane frameworks, structures, ideologies, and systems that exploit, terrorize, demonize, diminish, degrade, oppress, and indoctrinate in every corner of the globe. I do not make light of these realities. &lt;cite&gt;The Hunger Games&lt;/cite&gt; is just fiction, but for me, it's a way to explore these situations and to pull these realities closer to my own—they're not far off things in far off lands happening to some people. These realities are human, they are tangible, they affect me personally and they should affect me; affect us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Async Humanity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was tidying up my desk and catching up to the final chapters of the book, all of a sudden the reading stopped. One second passed: &lt;em&gt;Maybe she’s taking a drink&lt;/em&gt;. Three seconds passed: &lt;em&gt;Did I accidentally pause the video?&lt;/em&gt; Five seconds and I finally realize my sister is struggling to continue reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My short-term memory spat out what we just read and what we were about to read: yet another tragedy from the slaying of a small child. Yet another battle of survival against the threat of the attacking child. Tears had come. The words were there but they couldn’t be said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sat there in distress. This was something I’ve struggled with for so long: allowing my sister to be hurt, to be sad. I’ve never wanted her to feel those things, and even when I’ve been the one teasing, I feel immense guilt. I’m supposed to protect her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I can’t do anything—this sadness, this hurt, it has all already happened, because this is a recording. All I can do is sit there “with” her, feeling the pain, feeling the sadness—not just from the book, but also from my sister’s experience with the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a lesson my therapist has been trying to help me understand: I can’t fix the discomfort or distress or sadness or pain of other people. I have to just be there with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, this may not have been helpful for my sister—I can’t speak for her experience being so vulnerable for &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; long on the video. To me, it was powerful because I realized this couldn’t have happened on a normal audiobook experience. When I’m listening to an official recorded book and start to cry, the performance moves on without me, and I end up suppressing the emotion, burying it for another time. But this time, it was baked into the experience. Fast-forwarding was an unthinkably violent act. There was no way out but through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An audiobook of silence was when I heard the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cyborg&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a cruel paradox to live in this world, knowing that anywhere &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; people are suffering, all the time, for all possible reasons, and still having to live life yourself. The horrors we inflict upon each other affect us all—there is no purity of cause, no true righteousness, because you can always pull on a string that leads you to yet another system, yet another travesty, yet another incomprehensible situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we can’t escape and we can’t fix it (as &lt;em&gt;individuals&lt;/em&gt;), then what are we even doing here?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not a therapist, so this isn’t advice, but I think something that I’m learning is that I must slow down. It’s not just about mental health, nor curbing addictive content feeds. It’s about tapping into humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t console my sister—it was literally impossible. I can’t fix the famine and oppression in Gaza; I can’t save the people who are terrorized just because of their ethnicity or race or queer identity; I can’t heal the sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing I can do is witness and weep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, I can do what I can do to humanize those whom I have seen—really &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt;—so that we can start to reconnect and abandon the follies that got us here.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Disadvantaged Conundrum</title><link>http://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/disadvantaged-conundrum/</link><description>In a private communications channel centered around exploring AI, I posted several papers and articles that discussed the biases that are baked into AI (gender, race, etc.) and at the end asked:

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How do we know that [Product Name] AI doesn't have some or many biases? Is this a blindspot?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was attempting to start a conversation that would lead to some introspection. Instead I was met with some resistance, deflection, and dollop of man-splaining. The first response posed an important question, though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;...I'm not sure we could ever eliminate it entirely. Not saying that we shouldn't try, we absolutely should—I think the biggest question is, how do we make it economical to do so?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we explored &lt;a href="/newsletters/are-we-asking-the-right-question/"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;, though, the question sometimes needs to be questioned. I think this reveals some thinking errors in our current system, noble as it may seem to try and seek humane solutions through capitalism. I was able to muster enough courage to ask a confronting question in response (&lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; difficult for my submissive personality): &amp;quot;Is it ever economical to protect and focus on humanity?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it ever &lt;em&gt;economical&lt;/em&gt; to do what's right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe—I'm no expert in economics nor political science—but personal experience tells me probably not. I've never personally seen a company (private or public) motivated to do what's right just because it's right. In fact, that's where I've run into some walls that I can't yet figure out how to climb, and I think this will help us examine this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Disabled God&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I think of Greek mythology, Zeus, Athena, and Artemis come to mind: warrior gods; strong; fickle for sure, but powerful and able-bodied. I only recently found out that there is a god in the Greek pantheon who is disabled: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hephaestus"&gt;Hephaestus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's the blacksmith god who decks out Achilles with a shield and crafts other armaments for various gods. According to the &lt;em&gt;Illiad&lt;/em&gt;, Hephaestus enlists the help of automatons like &amp;quot;handmaids&amp;quot; made of hammered gold and wheeled tripods to assist with his craft and help him move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But Hephaestus also limps along on withered limbs, anticipating the great insight that both Plato and Marshall McLuhan would later insist upon: the technologies extend our creative powers by amputating our natural ones.&amp;quot;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;—Erik Davis, &lt;cite&gt;TechGnosis&lt;/cite&gt;, pg. 18&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, this starts to paint the picture of the conundrum that I'm in. Accessibility is the degree to which public spaces (physical or virtual) are usable by people of varying degrees of ability. Ideally, that would mean everyone can use a space or get what they need from a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would think that this is just the default mindset, because when you spell it out it just makes sense. &lt;em&gt;Of course&lt;/em&gt; we want people to be able to use our website, then we get more potential customers. However, despite my own conviction, despite my own advocacy efforts, I still haven't found sufficient time to learn and do everything I would like to in order to support accessibility in my work. I have to give the same trainings or reminders to the same designers on a consistent basis to stop putting together colors that don't have enough contrast just to read the text. If we can't move past the most basic accessibility principle, how can we ever get to a place where what we're creating is actually accessible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most jobs in most companies, the priority simply isn't there. And when it is, it still doesn't help like it &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt;. In my naïveté, I once dreamed of starting a business in which I could build tools for someone with disabilities that would enable them to do their job as competitively as an able-bodied person. I thought that python code was the answer, because it had helped me stay afloat during my MS attack. But the economics weren't there. I was not able to figure out how to do it at a scale that would support my own livelihood, since I would have to custom-build tools for each specific job. Then came generalized AI, the adaptive solution that could help someone accomplish a variety of possible tasks—the golden handmaids of Hephaestus, if you will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of empowering the disabled to contribute and be included like Hephaestus, however, technology, especially with generative AI, seems to further disadvantage the disadvantaged. Rather than assisting us all equally, I am seeing evidence that AI is simply infiltrating as a competitor to humanity &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; creating a rift between the least- and most-abled people, like oil forcing water to the side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/dY6WRWfeJQbWdxN1R4ENgw/email" alt=""&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;AI inserted into the middle of a scale between the least- and most-able takes up the most space and pushes humanity to the sides.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm deeply troubled that not only does it prevent the disadvantaged from catching up or staying in the same place, it's actually forcing them down. At what point will a company decide to hire a less-able person over some dirt-cheap AI product? At what point do we say, &amp;quot;let's prioritize removing racial and gender biases from our AI product&amp;quot; instead of, &amp;quot;how can we capture more of the market this quarter&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are giving up on critical thinking, artistic expression, and basic logic, because they just lean on AI summaries or generated content. I'm starting to find AI-generated videos pretending to be funny &amp;quot;can't believe they caught it on camera&amp;quot; videos. The inauthenticity and the further reduction of quality that we are tolerating is the most disturbing to me. AI has served us well in fields of deep expertise, like in medical technology, but the current deployment and application of generalized AI doesn't seem to be helping as much. Erik Davis is spot on from what I'm seeing: &amp;quot;the technologies extend our creative powers by amputating our natural ones,&amp;quot; but it seems like the public-facing, general AI amputates more than it extends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cyborg&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no answers, I have no way to wrap this up nicely. I'll be honest that I'm despairing this week more than usual, because it feels so big and AI is simultaneously speeding things up. The safety mechanisms of regulations, standards, and laws feel paper-thin (especially laws in the U.S. right now). Where we could have deployed AI in a more human-focused way, we've opted for the &amp;quot;quick profits now, fix things later&amp;quot; approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like a cog in a system that is starting to spin too fast—it's creating smoke in the machine and sparks are starting to fly. At what point do we end up burning out and tanking the whole system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I know is that I can't solve this one on my own. I don't know how to remove prejudice, take care of the disadvantaged, and improve the circumstances of the disabled at scale. So I guess I put my shoulder onto the wall again and keep pushing until it either breaks through or I get strong enough to climb over.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Are We Asking the Right Question?</title><link>http://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/are-we-asking-the-right-question/</link><description>When I was first diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), it took almost 6 months for me to start to recover from my MS attack.

During that time I became acquainted with a question that still looms over me: Where is the worth of a person?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the more finalized version of the question. It started out with a lot more judgment and ableism. My prior model of the world involved measuring my worth by my productivity and achievement. I was only worth as much as I could learn, do, and produce—and it wasn't enough just in comparison with myself, it was all about how much better I was in comparison with everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the MS attack took away my ability to think clearly, to move in a coordinated way, to do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; that I was normally able to do, I could only see myself as worthless. The question I had was much more like, &lt;em&gt;When am I too worthless to be here?&lt;/em&gt; Eventually, however, I started challenging that first iteration of the question because it was harming me and I was desperate to find a better way—a healthier way—of thinking about my newfound condition. Many conversations with many people led me to adopt an assumption first, and then ask my question to see where it would go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assumption was: humans have inherent value. If that was true, then how can you have any worth if you can't do anything? I was still thinking in terms of ableism and productivity, but the question was at least pointed the other way: instead to trying to determine how you lose your value, I was searching for how (or whether) you &lt;em&gt;maintain&lt;/em&gt; value, even when you can no longer contribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was where I landed for more than five years (and I still find myself falling back to this version of the question when times are tough). I get stuck on &amp;quot;contribution&amp;quot; as a function of value: the more you contribute, the more valuable you are. But that doesn't explain why people love and care for others who are extremely disabled; bedridden; paralyzed; even comatose. I felt like I had to understand the extreme cases to console myself and find human worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, however, I noticed that my question was still flawed—influenced by a system that does not prioritize our humanity, but attempts to suppress it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The AI Question&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen so many headlines and assumptions that say that Artificial Intelligence (AI) challenges what it means to be human. There has been unprecedented progress in generative AI's abilities to produce good work. We, somewhat collectively, do feel the threat of replacement looming as tech bros proclaim that AI will replace the majority of knowledge workers in just a few years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is AI &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; challenging what it means to be &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I readily admit that I tend to be contrarian—highly suspicious of collective &amp;quot;wisdom&amp;quot; or conclusions that are shared on viral videos or memes. So when I see that the assumption behind this question put forth by journalists and creators, is that humanity is as simple as our productivity at work, I start to wonder if we've got the wrong question in our minds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like my journey with MS and my struggle to understand my worth, I got stuck on a poor question. It did not propel me forward, it kept me confounded. The AI question and my second question are the same: is the worth of a human tied to their productivity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That question puts us on a path that tries to insert humanity into that which is absent of humanity by nature. We've discussed HADD Theory before, and I still find it the most compelling theory to explain why we squabble about whether these chat bots are conscious—our brains are designed through evolution to notice and assign agency to things even if it's all imagined. I bring this up because I think that the question of AI consciousness is a dangerous distraction; a question that gets us stuck when there are real, pressing problems that should be addressed before we try and figure out if AI is alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we get stuck on determining if AI is a kind of human, then we will be on the lookout for evidence. We will compare our humanity to what can be done on a computer. If AI can do it, and can sometimes do it better—then where does humanity fit? The question is faulty, because, again, we're assuming that our productivity is what makes us human; what makes us valuable. AI replaces human productivity, therefore, AI is worth the same or more than humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But our worth is not in our productivity. Our worth is not comparable to AI in any way; it is wholly independent of any form of AI, sentient or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cyborg&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to be careful about the questions we ask, because they influence what we are able to uncover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do recognize that the AI question is also one of practicality: if we get replaced by AI, how do we continue to provide for ourselves in our current system? If everyone gets laid off, then how do we support anything? How do we survive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of that question must be answered with policy and regulation. We must do something to protect laborers' (including knowledge workers') rights and remove power from the richest who are poised to exploit and profit the most. I don't know any other way right now to coexist with AI as a competitor in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I think we also need to move onto the more important version of the question of human worth. Maybe the next economic and social systems can only be constructed by focusing on it. For now, at least, it is how I find progress amidst uncertainty, distress, and fear. To keep the question in mind, &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; does my value come from?&amp;quot; forces me to accept the assumption that I do have value. Divorced from productivity or skill or achievement or status or money or possessions or any other thing, there is only one explanation for where the worth comes from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I exist.&lt;/p&gt;

This particular phantom was a canvas that I had messed up while painting. It had a beautifully blended rainbow background, starting at the top with a deep crimson, melding into orange and yellow, then somewhat sharply changing to green, then blue, and a hint of indigo at the bottom. The idea was to depict a sunset over water, so that my Pride-flag colors could be projected onto a somewhat natural scene. The only flaw was that the transition to the &amp;quot;water&amp;quot; surface got a little too abrupt with a few misplaced strokes of green that were too high to make it appear intentional, and too dark to hide under another coat of yellow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally fed up with its taunts, I grabbed my paints, determined to try again. I had a ruined canvas before me, but the original image and composition still interested me, so I turned it into an experiment to see if it could work in a different style: instead of a perfectly smooth gradient, I opted for something messy and chaotic. I layered on the paint, rebuilding scene on top of the previous one, but this time I didn't care about perfection. I wasn't painting—I was playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In perfect irony, the final image was much more visually appealing—even with the exact same issue that it had before: small green splashes of paint on top of the fragile yellow area. I had gotten carried away with my palette knife, just like I had with my brush last year. This time around, however, this doesn't bother me—it's not trying to be photo-realistic, it's trying to say something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wu Wei&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;cite&gt;Dao De Jing&lt;/cite&gt;, this phrase &lt;em&gt;wu wei&lt;/em&gt; comes up a lot. It describes a concept of non-coercive action. It's about flowing instead of forcing. While I'm not going to do justice in explaining (or even understanding) this Taoist concept, what I have learned in trying to wrap my Western mind around it has been insightful and widely applicable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first iteration of my painting process was mostly me trying to force something. When I made a big mistake, it was unrecoverable. I had built a fragile system—a collection of decisions that could not adapt to variability. So when I prepared to try again, I tried tricking my brain into letting go by treating my canvas as if it were another being that I was going to interact with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can animate the painting (i.e. treat it as if alive) and imagine that it has a will of its own, and our job as artist is to &lt;em&gt;reveal&lt;/em&gt; that painting: listen to it, pull it out. I think that's an intuitive way that many artists like to think of their work, especially &lt;a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/elizabeth_gilbert_your_elusive_creative_genius"&gt;after the Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; shifted the pressure to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; the genius rather than to &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; a genius. It's much easier on your mental state if you can separate yourself from what you produce. Otherwise, you may get too deep into judgment or worry more about unachievable standards than making the art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second iteration of my painting had the intention of losing myself in the process: I wanted the painting to reveal itself to me through &lt;em&gt;wu wei&lt;/em&gt;—flow—making decisions based on what was presented to me, rather than playing god and forcing it to do what I want even when it doesn't work. This method was more enjoyable because the stakes were removed. I wasn't trying to prove how technically skilled I was. I was watching the painting take shape over time and reacting to what I saw. I still had a basic composition in mind, but it was not about copying my imagination directly onto canvas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam Savage, one of the hosts of the hit series &lt;cite&gt;MythBusters&lt;/cite&gt; (2003–2016), had a similar experience on his YouTube channel, &lt;cite&gt;Tested&lt;/cite&gt;. He was &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Log-43c9oo8&amp;amp;pp=ygUgYWRhbSBzYXZhZ2UgdGVzdGVkIGRpbm9zYXVyIGVwIDQ%3D"&gt;building a life-size &amp;quot;velociraptor&amp;quot; puppet&lt;/a&gt;, similar to what you'd see on &lt;cite&gt;Jurassic Park&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;There's a moment in which the object tells you what it's going to be,&lt;/q&gt; he remarked. He had been set on creating a green-toned skin for his dinosaur model, but as he worked with it, he ended up changing the entire color scheme to a more sandy/desert style, and I personally thought it was the perfect choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my mind, this is &lt;em&gt;wu wei&lt;/em&gt;. It's a collaboration between material and artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rawhide Drum Making&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a community class last year that promised a rawhide drum that we would make and learn to play. It was quite simplified and most of the difficult work was done outside of the class by the material suppliers (all from Indigenous-owned businesses). We had wood frames already made and even the rawhide had been dyed and processed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though we were really just &lt;em&gt;assembling&lt;/em&gt; the drum, rather than making one from scratch, there was still a part of the process that tapped into this &lt;em&gt;wu wei&lt;/em&gt; concept. The instructor showed us how to take our pre-soaked rawhides and pull them taught around the wood frames. It was a lot of pulling and folding and manipulating the hide, trying to coax it to conform to the circular shape without too many creases or bumps. Then we added the rawhide strings to the back to keep the tension and create the handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/eTeK6CU7kv65ta7zYxhqSv/email" alt=""&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Back of the drum, showing nine tensioning strings with two wrapped together to form a handle to grasp.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;The animal will tell you about itself,&lt;/q&gt; my instructor said as she wandered through the desks. &lt;q&gt;You can have an idea of what it will be, but ultimately, you have to work with the deer to let it show you what it will become.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the best part of the class: getting yet another culture's perspective of this &lt;em&gt;wu wei&lt;/em&gt; concept. The hide of the deer told me a story: it has scars and bumps and spots that showed through the dye. In a way, the animal still had some say in its transformation from hide to drum. It didn't matter how hard I pulled, there were parts that would not lie perfectly flat or curve the way I wanted. After stringing and tensioning the back, I discovered that the hide had a natural hole on the edge (as opposed to the pre-punched holes from processing), meaning I had nine lines instead of the expected eight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sound of each drum would also be unique, and change over time as the hide settled on the drum and dried. &lt;q&gt;Get to know your drum,&lt;/q&gt; became the instructor's refrain across each class session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, the final product was a collaboration, not a domination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/iDKTPNXrEJsYXUT7GCu1J3/ke4ebxYD8Wo33nvwJr5Aer/email" alt=""&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Front of the rawhide drum showing the scars that the deer had acquired during its life (all of the thin lines and some of the small dots are scars).
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cyborg&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this may seem to be art-focused, I believe that &lt;em&gt;wu wei&lt;/em&gt; is widely applicable and useful in our lives. Perhaps art is just a training tool to help us practice recognizing the paths set before us and then taking the opportunity to follow where they lead. Not to be confused with &lt;em&gt;inaction&lt;/em&gt;, non-coercive action is an attempt to work with what we have and to honor the agency or the dignity of other creatures and things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a modern context, we might be tempted to see things like a social media feed as following a path—after all, it is constantly providing you with things that are easily followed. This is &lt;em&gt;inaction&lt;/em&gt;, however, because you are not collaborating. Your agency and your &amp;quot;self&amp;quot; are being rushed through a river that is designed to trap you in it. You are the material and the company is the artist that asserts its dominance over you. &lt;em&gt;You will like this content, you will be distracted, you will be harvested for our gain without your true consent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all technology &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be this way. &lt;em&gt;Wu wei&lt;/em&gt; is difficult when our agency is not entirely our own, but it can be practiced, and it can be brought into your circumstance through intention. I believe this helps us flip back into a more agentive role, where we can become actors in our lives again, rather than objects ready to be turned into profits by other agents who do not respect &lt;em&gt;wu wei&lt;/em&gt; or the humanity of others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;em&gt;wu wei&lt;/em&gt; can help us work with others in a non-destructive way. How else can we achieve something within a collection of other agents? When we respect the agency of other people, and even other animals or objects, we allow the art of revelation to work towards a positive outcome. We can still have our own ideas, but we allow each participant to reveal themselves in the process. We will never end up with what a single individual imagined, but that is not a loss; it's an improvement. There are better times ahead when we adapt, update, and move collaboratively. Anything else is ultimately destructive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While splitting up the world in making distinctions within it might seem to have a functional value, it always entails a diminution. The most effective way of cultivating order in the world, invariably relies upon the power of inclusivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Instead, I travelled to an LGBTQIA+ conference to try and explore humanity &amp;quot;in real life&amp;quot; (something that's tough to do for an introvert like myself). I came away with some important themes that I think anyone, regardless of identity, can benefit from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Remember Who You Are&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far from a trite aphorism, this concept seemed to permeate through the speakers and breakout sessions. Particularly in the sense of relationships with others, it's vital to remember who you are, and that you matter. I'm not even close to good at this, as I tend to yield to others' needs or wants, diminish my contribution to conversation, and assume that I don't matter even while affirming that everyone else absolutely does matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that's why this idea seemed to stick out to me, but here are a couple of snippets that I heard:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In response to the question of how to approach someone whose values conflict with yours: Values are different than personhood. If they want to deny you your personhood, that's not a value-based conflict. Remember who you are: you deserve dignity, respect. Removing those things from a person has nothing to do with &amp;quot;values&amp;quot; and everything to do with dehumanizing you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the &amp;quot;yielders&amp;quot;: Dare to say what's on your mind and reveal yourself. That's how you get stronger. Remember that who you are matters; your perspective; your needs; all of you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes it's hard to maintain your sense of self in a relationship. The struggle is remembering: who am I and who are you in our relationship? Failing to remember who you are, even in a very close relationship, like with a spouse, can become unhealthy and ultimately betrays both you and the relationship. (Please speak to a mental health professional to explore more about any of this—not a therapist, here, just a curious writer!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We Are Starved For Love&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lesbian bishop was part of a conversation for one of the sessions. She mentioned that she noticed throughout her ministry that people are starved for love—everyone, not just marginalized groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;We are so miserly with our love,&lt;/q&gt; she emphasized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My tech-sense is tingling, and I wonder how we might find a better balance between our personal relationships and the strange new &amp;quot;tribes&amp;quot; that social media has caused to emerge. Note that I'm using the word &amp;quot;tribe&amp;quot; sarcastically, since that's a term ill-suited for these bizarre identity-based political groups, even though that's how you see it used across the Internet. In fact, I wonder if these false tribes have contributed to the collapse of our in-person relationships and have caused us to hoard our love, preventing it from leaking out to real people in real life. In fact, Dr. Lisa Diamond mentioned this in reference to non-human forms of safety-signaling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;Our brains evolved to get our safety from actual people.&lt;/q&gt; Not signs or flags (or, I would add, AI). You can make your life safer with just one or two connections. This is an act of resistance—the world wants you divided and isolated. Instead, increasing our in-person time with people we are safe to be ourselves with will help us reverse many of the negative effects we're seeing from our isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all starved for love, so let's try to stop hoarding it and instead share it with the people in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trust That I Know Myself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the under-represented groups within the LGBTQIA+ community are the asexual (often shortened to &amp;quot;Ace&amp;quot;) and aromantic (&amp;quot;Aro&amp;quot;) groups. People who identify as Ace don't experience sexual attraction, and those who identify as Aro don't experience romantic attraction. This isn't a tragedy, this isn't a problem to be fixed. This is yet another example of the beautiful diversity of human experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presenter who spoke from this group happened to be both Ace and Aro (somewhat rare). Her remarks had a consistent theme: don't invalidate someone's identity. She has been constantly peppered with questions like, are you sure? Have you just not met the right person? Or receiving comments like, &lt;q&gt;that's so sad I could never imagine not loving someone.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;People don't see my identity as real or valid,&lt;/q&gt; she summarized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking about how a person can have a vastly different experience than my own, it reminds me of how Ed Yong helped readers of his book, &lt;cite&gt;An Immense World&lt;/cite&gt;, get used to the idea of understanding the experience of other animal species:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our umwelt is still limited, it just doesn't &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; that way. To us, it feels all-encompassing. It is all that we know, and so we easily mistake it for all there is &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; know. This is an illusion—and one that every animal shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;aside class="bracket"&gt;
NOTE: &lt;em&gt;umwelt&lt;/em&gt; is a term he uses to refer to the reality a creature inhabits based on its sensory perception—not just its environment, but how it understands and perceives it.
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only do we humans have a broad &lt;em&gt;umwelt&lt;/em&gt;, we also have our own personal &lt;em&gt;umwelts&lt;/em&gt;—based on our senses, our abilities, our experiences, and our identity. With such diversity just within our own species, we can't possibly &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; someone else's experience, but that doesn't mean it isn't real. Our experience may seem complete, all-encompassing, and all there is to know, but that is truly an illusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard enough to &lt;q&gt;know thyself,&lt;/q&gt; how do we ever dare to tell other people who &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; are (or who we think they should be)? Trust that I know myself, and work to know &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;self.&amp;quot; No need to steal that responsibility from someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Human&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sat by myself in my introverted bubble for most of the conference, frequently weeping in silence. It's been quite the year of pain, isolation, and, most of all, feeling terrified that my neighbors might turn into persecutors. The rage and demonization expressed throughout the U.S. presidential campaign and new administration have set fire to my nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To take a break from that and sit in a room with 1,100 other queer people or allies was overwhelming. It was social safety, which, going back to Dr. Diamond again, is when you feel OK &lt;em&gt;as you are&lt;/em&gt; with other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew no one there personally, but tears immediately blinded me just by stepping inside a building where I knew I could be myself: introverted, queer, and everything else in between. There's something special about our humanity, and it's so easy to fade into the background of my day-to-day life. But this was a much-needed reminder that there are still humans out there. There is still community to be had. There is still dignity to be shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You matter. I matter.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>The Shadow of Humanity</title><link>http://cyborgnewsletter.com/newsletters/the-shadow-of-humanity/</link><description>&amp;quot;Dad!&amp;quot; I yell with exasperation. &amp;quot;Can you come take a look at this?&amp;quot;

&lt;p&gt;Something spins on my computer screen, error codes displayed on a box. I click randomly to no avail, but suddenly the screen refreshes, the error is gone, and everything works perfectly. I spin around to find my dad has entered the room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh sure, now it's working! Just 'cause you're here,&amp;quot; I say. He chuckles and retreats the way he came. &lt;em&gt;Computers really like him,&lt;/em&gt; I think, as I continue on tinkering with whatever's on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moments later, I might get called down by my mom to help her with some computer issue, only to have the exact same thing happen—everything is broken until I come to look, then the computer decides to shape up and act as though nothing had happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe computers do enjoy the gaslighting, but long-time readers of CYBORG_ know that my personal stance on anthropomorphizing machines is a dangerous distraction, and probably has more to do with &lt;a href="/newsletters/the-problem-we-are-avoiding-with-ai/"&gt;our brain's evolution&lt;/a&gt; than these systems having an actual &amp;quot;being&amp;quot; or consciousness. However, there is something that happens when the fingerprints of humanity are left on our machines, and that might bring out some surprising behavior from the cold, stoic technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shadows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know about you, but when I think about technology, I think of it in terms of stability, facts. It's unfeeling, unbiased, unemotional. It's something reliable. 1+1=2, no matter how many times you punch it into the calculator. If you get the wrong answer, it's because you, the human, messed up—garbage in, garbage out after all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is it, then, that we're seeing really good evidence that artificial intelligence has &lt;a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/news/covert-racism-ai-how-language-models-are-reinforcing-outdated-stereotypes"&gt;racial biases&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/full-gender-shades-thesis-17/"&gt;Gender biases&lt;/a&gt;? If AI really is just another tool, why is it falling for the same old fallacies, stereotypes, and prejudices that we humans have? Does this not demonstrate a kind of consciousness? Or maybe it means that the human creators were pulling the wrong levers—passing their personal biases onto their creation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there is more to it than simply pointing at the creators and saying they just hard-coded some problematic stuff into it (not that they don't have serious responsibility for what they &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; done, bad intentions or not). I also do not think this is actually unique to AI alone. Potentially, these biases have accompanied our tech for far longer than we've realized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this observation by Jun'ichirō Tanizaki:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese music is, above all, a music of reticence, of atmosphere. When recorded or amplified...the greater part of its charm is lost...Most important of all are the pauses. Yet [the recordings] render these moments of silence utterly lifeless. And so we distort the arts themselves to curry favor for them with the machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a guess when this was written. 2000? 1990? Maybe 1970? Nope. He wrote this in his essay, &lt;cite&gt;In Praise of Shadows,&lt;/cite&gt; back in 1933. Even more profound were the musings on technology and culture. Tanizaki mourns the losses felt in Eastern culture as Western technology was invading: photography, radio, trolleys, airplanes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He notes that, left alone, the East may have continued to develop slowly—at their own pace—but that they &lt;q&gt;would have gone only in a direction that suited us.&lt;/q&gt; The technology would have been developed in support of their values, their complexions, their landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;They would have been no borrowed gadgets, they would have been the tools of our own culture, suited to us.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, this was a paradigm shift. Suddenly, I can see how technology is not some set-apart thing. It absolutely does have bias, opinion, stereotypes, built in. Not necessarily due to ill-intent or some grand attempt at large-scale oppression (though that's &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; possible). But technology is inescapably linked to culture and the values of that culture will therefore permeate the tech for better or worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not because the technology is alive or conscious or self-aware. It is because technology is the shadow of humanity. We build it after our likeness, and it reflects that shaping back to us—recognizable if we decide to look at the shadow, but just as easily slipping into the environment as a subtle, unimposing thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shadows can create beauty as Tanizaki argues in his essay, but they can also hide dangers. Perhaps especially for Westerners, shadows are uncomfortable. Maybe we're afraid of seeing what we've built into the darkness. If you can bear to look at the shadow, the question becomes: what do you see?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
