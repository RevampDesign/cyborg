            <p>The promise of technology is to make things easier. Humans learn the most through hard things: suffering, hard work, mistakes. </p>
<p>We're in a paradox already.</p>
<p>In college, I somehow made it onto the snareline in marching band my Freshman year. </p>
<p>Throughout high school, I had dedicated my precious hours before and after school to percussion. Perfecting technique, practicing solos and parts, watching and listening to ensembles and marching bands and DCI (Drum Corps International).</p>
<p>It was an incredible moment to hear my name called after try-outs: &quot;Jess Brown: Snare.&quot;</p>
<p>I was so out of my league. Even with all of the practice and all of my time, passion, and energy, I really wasn't as good as the other musicians there. I had to work twice as hard to keep up with people who could magically sight-read complex rhythm patterns.</p>
<p>Sight-reading has always been my Kryptonite. I've practiced it for years and years, and it just doesn't come for me. I have to memorize my parts. Blast through everything over and over and over again. At one, mortifying moment, my esteemed, decorated Percussion professor had me in for a private lesson and discovered this weakness. He told me, &quot;You were a snare—I thought you were good.&quot;</p>
<p>That was the end of my pursuit of music in college. Even though I had proven myself at every performance, every concert, every band practice, every football game, the one chink in my armor—inability to sight-read—meant I was a failure.</p>
<p>I only had that one year of music in college. It was so important to me, and I failed.</p>
<h2>Why Do Hard Things?</h2>
<p>Last week, I happened upon a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWPGv_Gf10A">video about Drum Corps</a> and how intense it is. Even though I never had a true Drum Corps experience, marching band in college had a similar feel to it. This video brought back all of the emotions, the satisfaction, the feeling of victory when you play well together.</p>
<p>That Freshman year was so fundamental to my growth as a young adult, even with the bitterness of utter failure seeping into my memories.</p>
<p>I didn't have to pursue music—I had already declared my major as Fine Arts: Graphic Design. And yes, I did get a scholarship to be on the marching band, but that wasn't even a part of my motivation (though certainly a perk).</p>
<p>I pursue music because it moves me. </p>
<p>It is the hardest thing I've ever learned. I was used to book-learning and that came easy for me. Nothing about music comes easy for me. It is a brutal, unrelenting, painful thing and I just can't get enough.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's the hard things that make us feel the most satisfied. Sometimes it's the hard things that help us make the most progress.</p>
<p>It's trite, and cliche, I know. But the wisdom that created these platitudes is still wisdom despite the platitudes.</p>
<h2>Choices</h2>
<p>With technology removing so many of the stumbling blocks to do things like gain access to education and entertainment, make money or take payments, create content and consume it; we have an increased responsibility to make choices.</p>
<p>The world I grew up in (pre-smart phone) demanded less of my attention. I was able to follow the structure of school and chores, but outside of that, I could just choose to do things I wanted to do, even if my pool of choices was somewhat limited.</p>
<p>Ironically, the post-smart phone era introduced more choices, but my ability to choose was hampered by all of the attention-hacking.</p>
<p>I don't think we have the luxury anymore of choosing not choose. I don't sit around bored like I used to. If I have time available, then I better be using it for XYZ projects or playing a video game or watching YouTube.</p>
<p>The ease of access to things through technology has made it harder to do hard things. It can remove momentum or friction—both of which we need to pursue hard things.</p>
<p>Back to the video about Drum Corps (timestamp: <a href="https://youtu.be/RWPGv_Gf10A?si=mQhqQ-nxGbABCoii&amp;t=890">14:50</a>), a young man said something that caught me by surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's a life lesson of learning discipline, actual life lessons, and just how to be a human in a world full of, like, screens and chillin', and wanting everything—almost like a microwave...</p>
<p>&quot;I learned how to be more financially responsible, just so I could save up to do this activity. So I think this is a really good slap in the face of what humans are actually capable of if they...just decide. It's the definition of going after what you want; ...Drum Corps at its finest to me.&quot;</p>
<p>So, dear Cyborg, what can you do to re-engage with your humanity? What might help you explore your potential?</p>
<h2>Nuance</h2>
<p>As a final note, I don't want this to be a guilt-driven message. We all still do hard things despite our technology—life is hard, full stop.</p>
<p>Multiple Sclerosis is my un-chosen hard thing. I have to deal with this chronic illness regardless of technology or privilege, just like you all have at least one thing that is utterly terrible and difficult.</p>
<p>It's not just &quot;hard for hard's sake,&quot; it's not, &quot;push through,&quot; it's not, &quot;you can sleep when you're dead.&quot;</p>
<p>Hard doesn't mean destructive.</p>
<p>It's finding something outside your normal that will inspire and teach you, even as you endure it.</p>
<p>For me, I've been trying to play more with my exercise time. I want to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnMr2k5hT2DQ1lYXPtCCX11BXhkRJkUAF">inject creativity into the daily grind</a> of mandatory activity to keep my MS at bay (as much as that's possible). </p>
<p>As that becomes easier, maybe it's time to get back to the drums—I guess we'll see!</p>
<p>What will it be for you?</p>
