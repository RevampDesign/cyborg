            <p>AI has threatened a lot of people, but I think artists have been the most upset</p>
<p>As noted in GumGum's booklet <cite>ART.IFICIAL</cite> (2017):</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;There is something about artificial intelligence that inspires a low-grade panic in most people...AI represents a very practical threat to our economic well-being, eliminating jobs once performed by unskilled or junior workers.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;But pursuits that rely on and express our very humanity—art, literature, music—and the industries that harness that creativity were supposed to be safe.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those fields that express our humanity are indeed sacred spaces to us. You can see it in the struggle penned by many authors and script writers. In <cite>I, Robot,</cite> Will Smith's character asks Sonny the robot, <q>Can you compose a Symphony? Paint a masterpiece?</q></p>
<p>With wit, Sonny asks in response: <q>Can you?</q></p>
<p>It is chilling to think of the implications of losing our artistic pursuits and expression. An ever-optimized algorithmic garbage heap of junk-food style art, saturating us to the point of no longer experiencing real art.</p>
<p>Doom and gloom is not yet, however. I think we still have time to draw boundaries, claim the roles and responsibilities that are uniquely ours as humans. </p>
<p>That also means we'll have to intentionally invest in new skills. No longer is an artist a role for someone else—I think that technology is pushing all of us to become artists.</p>
<h2>Water simulators in Hollywood movies</h2>
<p>Take, for instance, the way Hollywood creates photo-realistic water for movies.</p>
<p>In Corridor Crew's video, <cite><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvNNm1kNu4">I Learned How to Fake Water Exactly Like Hollywood</a>,</cite> the process involves a sophisticated combination of science, tools, and systems designed to support the VFX artist. </p>
<p>There are still technically flaws—they're not simulating water down to the molecular level AND water interacts with other systems like dirt, air, etc.</p>
<p>At some point it's diminishing returns to model the complexity of physics and the natural world. Not just because it's complex, but because the whole point is to support the <em>story</em>—the part that the humans came for. </p>
<p>In the video, Jordan interviews Chris White, who remarks: <q>At the end of the day we we're still making movies and it's about telling the story.</q></p>
<p>These tools exist to aid and support the artist in telling the story. The need for an artist to guide the process and make decisions remains critical.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Even if we do reach a point where, on a molecular level we can perfectly recreate water, you would almost still need the artist in order to draw it in such a way that it tells the story that needs to be told.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>What is an Artist?</h2>
<p>Artists combine technical skills with decision-making skills. They make connections. They tell stories.</p>
<p>It is my view that all humans are artists. It's not some gift given to the prodigious, rather it's an innate part of every human being. It's a role we inhabit when the need arises. It is sacred, impactful, and must be re-invested in.</p>
<p>We're quickly discouraged from artist pursuits in our current social structures (at least here in Western culture, specifically U.S. culture). A 5-year-old child will be endlessly creative, but a 10-year-old is already feeling the pressure to conform, to leave divergent thinking, to do things that are safer and rewarded more often.</p>
<p>So, how do we bring artistry back into our lives as adults?</p>
<h3>How to become an artist is non-traditional art (like a 9-5 job)</h3>
<p><strong>1. Improve your input</strong></p>
<p>Creativity often manifests in the fusion of disparate concepts. Consider Lindsey Stirling, who created a new form of artistic expression by combining her two passions: dancing and playing the violin. </p>
<p>Our work can present opportunities to blend multiple passions or skills or solutions. Sometimes, you have to discover it. Having a bank of new ideas, potential solutions, or even a breadth of knowledge increases that surface area where connections and solutions can be made.</p>
<p>Improve the quality and variety of your [[Input|inputs]]. It's the first step in cultivating innovative thinking and creativity in your own work.</p>
<p><strong>2. Hone Your Craft</strong></p>
<p>Continuously refine your skills: whatever makes your job easier and whatever helps inspire you to move forward. </p>
<p>It is vital to improve and to learn—both for your brain health and for your craft. </p>
<p>I've recently found that this part can be overwhelming. Once you're no longer a beginner and you realize how little you really know, the progress slows and it feels so much harder to learn or improve.</p>
<p>The point is to keep going, keep trying. It's not about milestones and measurements, comparison and competition. </p>
<p>This is your journey. No effort is truly wasted, because even failure is a teacher. Your craft, whether it's accounting, or teaching, or data entry, or web development, is a pursuit, not a destination.</p>
<p>Being on the journey <em>is</em> honing your craft.</p>
<p><strong>3. Experiment and  practice</strong></p>
<p>The continuous process of experimentation, refinement, and failure is where real artistry is born. </p>
<p>The experimental mindset allows you to explore new techniques, challenge your boundaries, and zero-in on your unique voice and style.</p>
<p>Putting in the time, the reps and also shaking things up frequently will help you break through barriers. It's hard, but it's also usually fun—hopefully.</p>
<h2>Cyborg</h2>
<p>As we look to the future with the technology that is rapidly advancing beyond what we can comprehend or keep pace with, we'll want to maintain our claim on artistry.</p>
<p>Tech will continue to push forward, and that can be used to our advantage or our disadvantage.</p>
<p>The hardest part is figuring out how to allow technology to push us up the proverbial ladder into strategic, decision-making roles, without letting technology push us off the ladder.</p>
<p>For now, I think the most important thing we can do is cultivate our creativity, practice decision-making, continuously experiment, iterate, update, and shake up our inputs.</p>
<p>We must all become artists—again.</p>
